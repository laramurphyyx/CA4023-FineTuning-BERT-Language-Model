68,"In light of new events, we have learned that after President Trump instructed the DOJ to reopen Hillary Clinton’s investigation in regards to her email hacking affair, she might be fleeing the country.

Where to, one might ask?

Well, as reports suggest, Hillary is packing her back to fly to good ole Canada.

Talk about feeling the need to chill!

Hillary and husband, Bill Clinton will pay a visit to the country, alongside daughter Chelsea and two grandchildren, residing at an estate in Quebec, known as Manoir Hovey.

Whether this is a long-term commitment or a short-term agenda is still unclear, but Hillary does have many reasons to abandon her homeland.

The timing is also immaculate, as Barack Obama decided to also leave for Indonesia, when the Susan rice case reached a boiling point.

After Rice’s testimony was delayed, which must have come as devastating to Obama, who was looking to avoid the drama.

The Democrats sure are travelers by nature!

Once the news of Hillary traveling to Canada broke, the Internet had a blast commenting.Take a look:

Are they seeking asylum ? — pump jack (@SheldonTwin24) August 9, 2017

While the Hillary investigation is set to kick off, she felt like this was a good time to leave, but has to back to the U.S. for her book publishing, scheduled for September. I guess she left many loose ends, which are now putting her in the inevitable position to face her doings.

One thing is certain- whichever the reason behind Hillary’s getaway, she must be trebling with fear that Trump could actually dig up something never revealed before. And let me tell you something- that is a good reason to be scared!",Fake
195,"(SP) – Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone named Blake Bortles the team’s starting quarterback today, putting a talented roster into the hands of a quarterback who has been one of the league’s worst over the past three seasons.

But instead of looking outside the team for a better quarterback, the Jaguars instead today doubled down on Bortles — and Marrone believes it will be enough to see Jacksonville win the AFC South and make the playoffs.

“There are many who say that Bortles isn’t a good quarterback and that he can’t throw football near his receivers and that he’s a proven loser,” said Marrone. “And not just many say that. All say it. Because it’s true. But one thing he does do is stand for the pregame national anthem — same as every quarterback who has won the Super Bowl. Sorry, but I think that’s some pretty good company to be in. I’ll take my chances.”

Jaguars receiver Allen Robinson said he is happy that Jacksonville is sticking with Bortles.

“Do I think we’ll make the playoffs with him? No, not at all,” said Robinson. “But knowing that he is somewhere on the sidelines standing up and not kneeling, will make the next three hours of losing 30-10 feel so much better.”",Satire
101,"WASHINGTON—A new report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center has found that the country that might completely shut down because the president wants a big wall is somehow considered the best in the world. The study determined that the 241-year-old federal republic, whose entire government may soon cease to function on account of the head of state’s desire for a big, tall, and thick wall stretching all the way from one side of the water to the other side of the water, remains widely viewed as an exemplary nation and the preeminent achievement in democratic governance.

Elder Patriot – CNN’s admission today that President-elect Donald Trump had indeed been wiretapped raises a serious question as to just who is in the business of spreading conspiracy theories.

It also suggests that Former F.B.I. Director James Comey deliberately perjured himself when he appeared before a House subcommittee and denied any knowledge that Donald Trump – first as a candidate and then as the president – had been wiretapped.

When President Trump tweeted that he had been wiretapped while in Trump Tower the media tried painting him as a conspiracy nut.

CNN pounced on Trump for starting a conspiracy theory and that the wiretapping claim was an “incendiary idea.” CNN was only the tip of the spear. MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The L.A. Times, the entirety of the Deep State controlled mainstream media all joined in discrediting the newly elected president.

Sponsored Links

Except for this:

A full 42 days before Trump’s tweet, the NY Times was the first to report that he had been wiretapped. That was before it was decided that it would be best to deny it ever happened because they found nothing incriminating.

That may not be illegal for a newspaper, especially a rag like the Times, but it is for any member of our intelligence community.

Sponsored Links

The fact that the wiretaps turned up nada meant that Obama had convinced the FISA court to give the NSA and the FBI a fishing license for political purposes. That is the way the Soviet Union operated against their political enemies.

In the United States our government is prevented from opening investigations without just cause. At least we thought so. Foolish us. After the IRS scandal why would we trust the Obama administration to play it straight on anything else? Shame on us.

Essentially the mainstream media chose to twist the emerging facts into knots once it became obvious that James Comey was lying to protect his illegal use of FISA court warrants under orders from President Obama.

From March 5th through March 21st we laid out the case in thirteen columns that Trump had been wiretapped for political reasons, Obama knew about it, and that Trump had trapped Comey into perjuring himself.

For our efforts we were castigated and the social media giants crushed the reach of our articles. We’ve come to recognize that we’re on to something big whenever the social media platforms begin limiting the number of people who get to view our work.

Today our investigative work was vindicated. The mainstream media, led by CNN, was forced to admit that the U.S. government, under President Barack Obama, had wiretapped Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, including his conversations with President Trump — both during after the 2016 presidential campaign.

That leaves Comey facing a perjury charge for lying, under oath, that Trump had never been wiretapped.

There is simply no possibility that Comey, as director of the F.B.I. wasn’t aware that Trump Tower had been wiretapped. If that had happened without Comey’s knowledge it was his job to bring the violators to justice.

Not so shockingly, Comey’s obfuscation wasn’t isolated. Another Deep State operative standing in direct opposition to Trump, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also denied any knowledge of the wiretapping.

If that is the case then who in the hell went before the FISA court, got the authorization from another of Obama’s crooked judges, and then executed the taps?

Question: Why isn’t anyone in any of the 17 intelligence agencies asking this question?

Answer: Because the government long ago stopped answering to We the People.",Fake

175,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Married father-of-two and American citizen Sean Spicer has vehemently denied ever holding the position of White House Press Secretary in a hastily assembled press conference on his front lawn this evening.

Mr. Spicer, who prohibited any video recordings of his short speech, told the gathered media outlets that reports that he served as White House Communications Director and Press Secretary from January to July 2017 were “fake news”.

“I am not now nor have I ever been the White House Press Secretary. I’d advise anyone who wants to hear from the White House should continue to consult the President’s Twitter timeline like the rest of us.” – Mr. Spicer

“These allegations are totally false and constitute fake news. It is my understanding that the President, whom I have never met, will be tweeting something to that effect shortly,” the recently unemployed Rhode Island native said, adding. “I’ll let the tweet speak for itself.”

In support of his claim the 45-year-old repeatedly misspoke, slurred his speech and mispronounced basic words including his own last name, giving those present the impression of someone wholly incapable of any form of public speaking.

“I don’t even know what a Press Secretary is,” he reiterated. “Perhaps you’re mistaking me for Melissa McCarthy. A lot of people do these days.”

Mr. Spicer then proceeded to take a few questions, calling on several reporters by name. He revealed that he was currently unemployed, having recently left his “dream job” due to excessive stress but had recently applied for a 3-month internship at The Onion and was taking Russian lessons in his spare time.

When presented with indisputable photographic evidence of him serving as Press Secretary to President Trump, Mr. Spicer refused to answer and instead slowly faded into his garden bushes.

Theresa May will use some of the control Britain will take back from the EU to strike a legendary trade deal with Nambia, it has emerged.

As divorce ‘negotiations’ with the EU continue, the British Prime Minister has already begun linking up with big players on the global scene, including an up and coming country somewhere in Africa.

“As we stand on the brink of leaving the EU, we are looking to create great trade deals with new partners,” she told reporters ahead of her speech in Florence today.

“It didn’t work out quite so well following our recent trip to Japan, admittedly, but with a bit of positive thinking, I’m sure we’ll get over that. There are plenty more fish in the sea, as it were.”

She explained, “For example, yesterday Donald Trump accidentally misdialed me instead of his local escort service, which was a bit of luck as while he was on the line he mentioned a prosperous country in Africa called Nambia that is just begging to strike up global deals with leading countries like ours.

“Apparently they have offered to supply all of his covfefe, and he has been very impressed with them so far.”

Proudly she added, “This is what Brexit is all about – being in control of our own destiny and prosperity.

215,"TRUMP TOWER – Soon after securing the Republican presidential nomination, business mogul/reality TV star Donald J. Trump swore off any and all assistance from the U.S. intelligence community, stating he did not trust the briefings he was set to receive as the nominee. “I won’t use them because they’ve made such bad decisions,” he said at the time.

The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts “has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won,” but he’s passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.’s incoming leader — who has no governmental or military experience — simply declined, declaring he’d rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.

“I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat,” Trump told Fox News, “if you can’t get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it can’t be that important anyways.”

Trump’s team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administration’s Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trump’s transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trump’s Twitter preference.

“National security is Donald Trump’s No. 1 priority and he’s taking it very seriously,” Nunes said. “Look how many leaders he’s met with, how many phone calls he’s taken, positions he’s filled. So what if he uses Twitter…he’s getting the job done.”

Mr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag.

9,"INI World Report > Uncategorized > THE UNANSWERED MYSTERY OF THE CENTURY!!!

A GREAT SIGNIFICANT SERIOUS MYSTERY ~ A MUST READ !!!

(and the answer to the final question below is: “No! just dumbed-down!!!”)

When Obama is out of office it will be interesting to see what they put in his “Library” regarding his early years. In a country where we take notice of many facets of our public figures’ lives, doesn’t it seem odd that there’s so little we know about our current man in the White House, Barack Obama?

For example, we know that Andrew Jackson’s wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery. Abe Lincoln never went to school. Jack Kennedy wore a back brace. Harry Truman played the piano.

As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single amazing fact about the history of our two term president — Barack Hussein Obama.

We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama, because the management of that document has been spectacularly successful.

There are however, several additional oddities in Obama’s history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue.

Another interesting thing: There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found?

It’s interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up. The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all know about JFK’s magnetism; that McCain was no monk; quite a few details about Palin’s courtship and even her athletic prowess; Joe Biden’s aneurisms are no secret; look at Cheney and Clinton — we all know about their heart problems. Certainly Wild Bill Clinton’s exploits before and during his White House years, were well known. That’s why it’s so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, “He was soooo shy…” or “What a great dancer…”

It’s virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow. Who was the best man at his wedding? Start there. Then check groomsmen.

Then get the footage of his graduation ceremony. Has anyone talked to the professors? It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him.

When did he meet Michele, and how? Are there photos there? Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc. for their library, etc. What has he released? And who voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010? Doesn’t this make you wonder?

Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obama’s past saying they knew him, attended school with him, or was his friend ? Not one person has ever come forward from his past, and that certainly is very, very strange.

This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man. Have you seen a movie named “The Manchurian Candidate” ? It is a classic, and it is pertinent.

As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face. Someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about us.

George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia — the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him.

If he is such a great orator; why doesn’t anyone in Obama’s college class remember him? Why won’t he allow Columbia to release his records? The fact is that Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University.

Looking for evidence of Obama’s past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there… but none remembered him.

Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama, “I don’t know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don’t have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever.”

Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of ’83 Political Science, and says, “You don’t get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don’t know anyone who ever met him. At class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who’s kind of the, as we say in New York, ‘the macha’ who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him.”

And Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, or to provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia.

Some other interesting questions: Why was Obama’s law license inactivated in 2002? It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam. and Why was Michelle’s law license inactivated by court order? We understand that was forced or required to avoid fraud charges.

It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama, but there are

27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias connected to him.

The Social Security number Obama now uses originated in Connecticut, where Obama is reported to have never lived. The number was originally registered to another man (Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut, who died in Hawaii while on vacation there. As we all know, Social Security Numbers are only issued once, and they are not reused. No wonder all his records are sealed !!!

Please continue sending this out. Somewhere, Someone has to know SOMETHING!?! School? Before he became an “organizer” in Chicago? SOMETHING!!! He just seemed to burst upon the Scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention. ANYONE??? ANYWHERE??? ANYTHING???

Surely in the near future, when he no longer has the power of the presidency, much will come to light about this highly unqualified person who has been president of the United States for 8 years. Soon, we will know how badly we were all doped and duped by this imposter who has, with much help from “those who created him,” nearly brought the greatest nation in history to its knees in ruins. And that will be his legacy — the man who destroyed the Integrity, Morals and Christian Heritage of our once great country.

178,"WASHINGTON, DC—The Vice President of the United States of America is said to be in a “critical condition” in the White House Medical Unit tonight after becoming trapped in an elevator with an unknown woman for almost 20 minutes.

Doctors at the WHMU say Pence is “lucky to be alive”, claiming “another minute” in the 8×6 ft. death chamber would have surely ended the Indiana native’s life.

“To be exposed to a young female in such a concentrated dose would be enough for any man, let alone one with such an extreme sensitivity to estrogen,” Dr. Mann told the NY Post. “It’s best that he avoid contact with any woman for a few months, aside from his wife of course.”

A White House spokesman claimed the V.P. had become momentarily separated from his Secret Service detail, leading to him entering the elevator unescorted. It is believed that Vice President Pence was unaware a solitary female was already present at the time, and as we now know, tragically this woman was neither his wife, daughter or mother.

The mysterious woman, currently being interrogated by Secret Service, was believed to have been fully grown, possibly reaching as tall as 5 feet 7 inches, meaning the Vice President stood little chance of suppressing his natural instinct to accept the woman’s undoubted lust for him.

“The fact that he was able to hold out for nearly 20 minutes without grabbing her is a testament to the kind of man, husband and feminist Mike is,” President Trump later told reporters. “God knows I would have cracked inside 60 seconds.”

According to CCTV the woman did attempt to dash out of the elevator once the VP entered, as is standard White House protocol for all female staff, but she was too late. The video shows the Vice President remained calm initially, casually ordering the woman to stand in one corner of the elevator and stare at her feet, with him doing the same in the opposite end. However, disaster struck once the elevator jerked to an abrupt stop and technicians informed the pair it could be up to 30 minutes before they would be freed.

Pence immediately began gasping for air and desperately trying to loosen his tie as he slowly slid down onto the floor. “I tried to help him,” the young lady screamed as Secret Service dragged her away, but this only made the situation worse as video evidence shows the woman was not wearing a skirt that fully covered her knee, sending the VP into anaphylactic shock.

Luckily emergency services were able to blast open the doors of the elevator in time to save the Vice President’s life and in all likelihood save the young lady from the electric chair.

Pence is expected to make a full recovery physically, however doctors warn the entire incident could result in some long-term psychological issues for the V.P. surrounding women.

31,"President Trump promised fiscal responsibility within government, using tax-payer monies wisely.

And he is delivering on that promise.

On Sunday, it was announced that the Trump administration is cutting it’s own budget by $22 million — in effect, Trump is leading the way by cutting funds to the White House, his current residence.

The Democrat party and the mainstream media have been oddly quiet about this big change…

Breitbart reports:

The savings come from a cut in the amount spent on Michelle Obama’s budget as First Lady, an end to the large number of “czars” and so-called “fellowships” that Obama employed, and a smaller White House workforce, Forbes magazine reported.

After the White House released its annual budget report last week, Adam Andrzejewski, president of government watchdog group OpenTheBooks.com, compared the newly reported budget to the last two years of the Obama administration.

Andrzejewski (pronounced And-gee-eff-ski) noted that there are now 110 fewer White House employees since Obama left office, saving nearly $5 million alone. Also, the First Lady’s staff has been cut from 24 staffers to only five. Michelle Obama entered the White House with a staff of 22 costing nearly $2 million annually, up from the $1.4 million spent during the George W. Bush era.

Another area of savings was the elimination of the so-called policy “czars” with which Obama stocked the White House staff. The Trump budget shows not a single “czar” employed for 2017.

Trump also seems to have ended Obama’s shady “fellowship” positions, people responsible for such special programs as Michelle Obama’s “Let Girls Learn” initiative and others. Some of these “fellowship” candidates in Obama’s administration made up to $158,000 annually.",Fake

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump announced late last night that congress voted 322 to 105 in favor of dismantling the statue of liberty, due to its “misleading statements” engraved on the pedestal.

The statue reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” According to Americans Against Illegal Immigration, along with our Republican Congress and Donald Trump, this statement misleads immigrants from other countries. It may have them believing they are welcome into America at any time.

“We do not want to allow the tired, poor and homeless into this country. We have enough of those already,” said President Trump. “If they’re tired, poor, and homeless in their own country, what makes you think they’ll do any better over here?Guarantee you they will go on welfare and rob people to survive. That’s what they do. I cannot Make America Great Again if we’re always feeding the hungry from other countries.”

The dismantling of the Statue of Liberty is set to begin March 1, 2018. It is estimated it will take two months to dismantle, then released for shipment back to France by the end of next year. The Statue of Liberty has been seated on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor since October 28, 1886.

The New York historical Museum has already vowed to occupy the area around the historic site for a “sit in” type protest where they will handcuff one another to form a complete circle around the base of the statue.

“They cannot tear it down if we form an unbreakable human barrier,” said José Ramirez, president of the Immigrant Resource Center of New York. “As Patrick Henry said, ‘Give me liberty, or give me death!’ We are not backing down.”

But not as controversial as the report that has come out of Washington DC today.

Hospital workers have come forward with new information that proves to be the largest breach of privacy United States citizens have ever uncovered.

According to several “hospital insiders” employees have been forced to microchip newborn babies in thousands of hospitals across the United States since 1983.

This small chip, when inserted at birth, can be found implanted in the thumb, or in the back of the neck.

It is as small as a grain of rice, and undetectable outside of the skin.

The serial number on the chip, is then linked to your Social Security number. You have been tracked your entire life.

“RFID Microchips are essentially a unique ID embedded in your body, and, as we know, numbers can be stolen and data can be hacked,” says University of Wollongong Prof. Katina Michael. “They point to an uber-surveillance society that is big brother on the inside looking out. Governments or large corporations have the ability to track people’s actions and movements, and ultimately even control them.”

This leaked information is expected to cause a major uproar in citizens of the United States born from 1983 to current.

You seem serious though. Do you mind if I smoke?Well I’m smoking anyway. Make America great again!Yeah, it was a big decision. Maybe the biggest ever. Almost as big as my election victory in November. They all said it was impossible, Crooked Hillary was gonna win. But then I won the greatest victory in history. The greatest!Global warming. How long will it take for the US to feel serious effects? These eggheads, what are they called again? Oh yeah, scientists. Anyway, they say that it’ll be really bad in 15 or 20 years. I’m 70 now and in 10 years tops I’ll be dead anyway, embalmed and lying in my gold mausoleum in Washington D. C. Why would I care about the climate?Ah, they’re rich. They’ll be fine. Ivanka, for example, is smart, rich and very sexy, too. The dream woman if you ask me. The planet can’t possibly get as hot as her.Well, to start with, the agreement was very unfair to the USA. At least, that’s what Steve Bannon and someone on FOX News told me. Also, why would I care about the climate in Paris? I might have reacted differently if it was the Pittsburgh climate agreement. Aside from that, one of my most important goals is to reverse everything that was put into place by this Obama [spits on the floor in disgust]. And: make America great again!We will do the opposite! We want to at least triple our carbon emissions by 2020, maybe even double them! No President before me has ever achieved that. We will do everything possible to reach this ambitious goal. We will convert our electric chairs to use combustion engines and wind turbines will turn backwards and consume electricity. If necessary, we will build factories which don’t even make anything. They’ll just burn trees and produce smoke. And that even has the side effect of generating jobs.That’s nonsense. Climate schlimate. I can’t understand why everyone is whinging again.

187,"Trump “Practicing Alphabets” Between Executive Order, Say Senior Staff

Washington D.C. (10:00 A.M. EST)—Addressing the media this morning, White House Spokesperson Sean Spicer confirmed reports that President Trump has recommitted himself to learning the English alphabet between signing executive orders. “The President has worked his way up to ‘R’ and continues to learn new, interesting letters each day for the American people,” said Spicer.

Though Trump has publicly stated his support for the current alphabet, a leaked draft executive order tentatively titled “Make the Alphabet Great Again” contained an order “suspending the letter ‘H’ from existence until we can figure out what’s going on.” Trump had campaigned on a promise to learn the alphabet during his first one hundred days in office.",Satire
216,"Houston, TX- Massive flooding this week left at least two dead and millions homeless as the administration scrambles to deploy thoughts and prayers to local governments in coordination with FEMA and other disaster relief agencies. “We’re just trying to get the thoughts and prayers out as quickly as possible”, a spokesperson for the administration said, “and if we can get the public to have an equally dedicated campaign to collect Facebook likes for these victims, we can really mitigate the worst of this.”









FEMA director Adam Brown told reporters earlier today that “retweeting victims’ posts really helps, please do that as much as possible. This is a serious issue that we can’t just swipe left.” Reports from the agency had indicated earlier today that upvoting could have some impact, but reacting on Facebook with a “wow” or, even better, the “angry face” would most likely be what turns the tide in effective response to this region.

“If you want to do literally everything you can to help the victims in Texas, you should like this article, then share this article, then like the one you shared and then comment so that your friends get engaged and then they start tagging people and everyone talks about how much it sucks and everyone posts pictures”, said President Obama. “Then go relax to your favorite show and have a beer. You’ve earned it.”

Story update: Victims are now saying they have received too many thoughts and prayers and will have to send some back. Houston has miraculously repaired all damage and now has a surplus of prayers while also lowering the deficit of thoughts..

83,"Hillary Clinton’s health scares have been extremely prevalent the past couple days. Even though the Clinton campaign has stated that she has pneumonia, there are people that think otherwise. In fact there is a claim that she might have Parkinson’s disease.

A Republican state representative for New Hampshire made the claim first, on his Facebook account. In fact there was a twitter post by a King Robbo that has evidence to this. “JUST BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED! Her aid asks her to “Squeeze My Fingers” A neurological test! NOT PNEUMONIA! …”

Now there is more evidence for this. Daniel Tamburello, the co-chair of the Veterans For Trump group, has explained that his father had Parkinson’s and pneumonia is common for people who suffer from it.

“They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”

Temburello created a Facebook post detailed what he knows about the disease.

“My Dad has had Parkinson’s since 1989, so I know a bit about the disease. Hillary has been rumored to have Parkinson’s for some time, as one of the theories to what ails her. (Personally I would surmise it is more than one illness).”

While not as educated as a doctor, Tamburello has probably talked to doctors over the past 25 plus years, so he does know what to suspect. Since it was a loved one that has had it, you can be assured that Tamburello is going to pay special attention.

“It has now been admitted she has pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the most common secondary conditions that occurs, and is a high degree secondary issue complicating Parkinson’s patients’ health that causes eventual mortality – again, very common to have Parkinson’s patients die of pneumonia.”

Since he has been dealing with a family member having Parkinson’s for over 25 years, he has probably heard all of this before. Again even though he is not a doctor, he probably has paid close attention to what has been said to him.

Why do a lot of people who have Parkinson’s die of pneumonia? Well Tamburello answers that as well. “The reason is a lack of being able to control the ‘valve’ on your throat that prevents water from going into your lungs when drinking.”

Everyone has experienced this before. When you drink something and then suddenly start coughing and hacking, it is usually because you tried to take a breath at the same time that you were swallowing. Most people refer to this as “going down the wrong pipe.”

Tamburello continues on in his post. “This in a combination with the recent fondness of mumus, makes me think she is concealing a deep brain stim battery pack that counters her tremors from Parkinson’s (my dad has this battery pack too).”

Well that would explain why you never see Clinton shaking, if she does have this. After all that is one of the more noticeable symptoms of Parkinson’s disease is the shaking.

Tamburello finished his post by saying, “They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”

He offers some evidence, and it could be a reasonable claim. However it appears that his Facebook post was removed. Why would it be removed? Well there are two basic options on why that would happen. The first reason is that it could be true and they don’t want people knowing, and the second reason is that Facebook is actively doing what it can to censor any and all anti-Clinton posts.

Facebook has a history of trying to censor right wing ideas. After all their trending news team was fired because of that specific reason.

Well there is more evidence for the first case. After Tamburello put his post on Facebook, people on Twitter started looking at the footage of Clinton’s collapse. And they started supporting his claim. Some of the users pointed out that her doctor did the “squeeze my fingers test.”

This specific test is a common way to determine neurological health. And furthermore, they use it to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. So all this evidence is going around that supports the claim that Clinton might have Parkinson’s disease.

Now naturally her personal doctor had released a statement that denied these claims. “Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.”

Well of course her doctor is going to say that. But it still doesn’t answer why someone who was helping her was telling her to “squeeze my hand.” And considering that the “squeeze my fingers test” is a common way to diagnose the disease, people are going to become very suspicious.

People were already wondering about Clinton’s health since she had failed to tell everyone that she had pneumonia in the first place. This is only going to pester her some more until she actually releases her medical records.

Share this article to show that the democratic presidential nominee might actually have Parkinson’s disease. With all the evidence that someone who has seen and dealt with the disease for over 25 years, and considering that someone who was there told her to “squeeze my fingers,” which is a common neurological test, it isn’t completely out of the question to say that she has it.",Fake
55,"TRUMP TOWER — With his poll numbers among black voters hovering around 1%, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reportedly tapped actress and FOX News contributor Stacey Dash as his “Negro Outreach Program” Ambassador.

“She connects with that group,” said Trump, “and she’ll be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. We’re lucky to have her. She’s controversial, but she’s one of the good ones.”









Dash recently created controversy by calling Grey’s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a “plantation slave” after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called “cultural appropriation.”

Trump said now more than ever, “especially with ‘Crooked Hillary’ siphoning off my blacks,” minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November.

“You know what will happen,” said Trump. “The media will come down on me for saying ‘my blacks.’ They did that in California with that African-American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I don’t’ care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach.”

One of those groups is the transgender community, Last June, the Clueless actress’ comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who “can’t decide what they wanna be that day” should go to the bathroom “in the bushes.”

Sources say Trump’s camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, Trump’s short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.

“She’s very well-informed. She’s quite affected. We’ve been looking into it,” said Trump.

When asked if the term “Negro” was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, “The trouble with saying ‘African-American’ is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them aren’t even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.”

“To be inclusive, we decided against ‘colored,’ since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to ‘black,’ because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with ‘negro.’ It’s historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.”

“Not everything is about race,” added the spokesman. “We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.”

129,"Tweet Tower—The Trump Organization is looking to borrow money from the Kremlin to help transform downtown Houston from its current soggy state to a lush and sprawling golf course resort. Many are calling this win, win, unless you happen to own property in an existing water hazard. President Trump pitched the idea to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner at a ballgame today, during a flood delay. The President believes an elite golf course with this many natural water hazards will attract “some of the best golfers across the globe. The best!”

Proponents of the plan believe the resort will both revitalize downtown Houston, while cutting costs on restoring water damaged sections. If approved by the city, the resort complex will encompass nearly half of the remaining flooded Metro area. The planned Trump Restored Ultra Mega-complex Pavilion (TRUMcP) will offer stunning views of the Houston skyline as well as provide the perfect spot for special events, weddings, and ongoing rescue efforts.

Trump told rally-goers at nearby Beaumont, “Hey, I said I would drain the swamp, but I never said I would drain this one. Ha! A lot of people are telling me, Donald, if you use Russian bank money for this project they will say it’s more collusion. I’ve had a lot of time to think about the word collusion and what it means to collude. I can even use it in a sentence now. Collude: I loved that old movie When Worlds Collude. That was a good movie. See, I made two sentences! I’m here ’til Friday! No really, I’m being told I should stick around this soggy shithole for the optics. Oh, and I can use optics in a sentence too.”

The President is denying rumors he might “accidentally” nuke Galveston so his new resort complex property will become part of the Gulf coast. When asked about the possibility of using the U.S. nuclear arsenal to sweeten a current real estate venture, the President said, “We’ll see. No options are off the table.”

50,"Many unanswered questions remain about the 2016 U.S. President Election in which Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton. The election was controversial and divisive on social media, where true and false political gossip was widely spread.

One of the countless election memes that were circulated online gave the impression that three years earlier Hillary Clinton made a statement to bankers the nation needed a business leader such as Trump as president.

What Did Hillary Supposedly Say About Trump?

In October 2016 an infographic spread on social media that Hillary Clinton said the following in 2013: “I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; they’re honest and can’t be bought.” Accompanying the quote was a photo of Donald standing next to Hillary, which was taken at the future president’s wedding to Melania in 2005.

Trump and Clinton Relationship

It should come as no surprise that either the Trump or Clinton families would say something nice about the other, as the two families became friends during Bill Clinton’s White House years. Trump praised and defended President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He also had positive things to say about Hillary in interviews when she ran for president the first time in 2008.

Even after the extremely negative 2016 campaign from both parties, Trump still spoke highly of the Clintons when they attended his inaugural luncheon in 2017, saying he had great respect for them. Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton particularly have had a close friendship over the years. Photos also show Donald Trump at a golf course with Bill Clinton.

So it’s not hard to believe that it would be very possible for Hillary to praise family friend Donald Trump three years before anyone knew what to expect about Obama’s successor.

What Fact-Checkers Say

The meme was debunked by fact-check sites and several major news sources that identified the origin of the fake quote as a discontinued Israel-based website. The website’s “About Us” page clarified the site mixed news with satire. Interestingly, several other satire sites were taken as fact during the election, leading to what could be argued as the biggest spread of political misinformation in the history of propaganda.

Both Factcheck.org and Politifact rate the quote as false – meaning it wasn’t a real quote by Hillary, as it apparently was meant as satirical humor. It’s no more true than saying Donald Trump made Mike Pence wear a training collar throughout his Presidency.

The closest thing Hillary said to the fake quote during her actual speech was “You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office.” She went on to say “you don’t have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom.” She never mentioned Trump at all in the entire speech.

The website claimed Hillary made a positive comment about Trump on October 29, 2013, at Goldman Sachs. Even though she actually did speak to the investment firm on that date, the transcript revealed the quote in question was nowhere to be found. The transcript of that speech was posted online by WikiLeaks.

Conclusion

As much as some people want to believe Hillary promoted Donald Trump for President in a 2013 speech, the quote was fabricated by a hybrid news/satire website. It’s one of many examples of how satire or another form of entertainment can be confused as truth for some people.",Fake

The Russians are employing the exact same tactics that we witnessed in Syria and during the two Chechen wars, but the mainstream media doesn’t seem to understand this. Up to this point, the mainstream media has used the fact that many major Ukrainian cities have not yet fallen as evidence that the war is not going too well for Russia. But the truth is that the Russians did not intend to recklessly send their forces into dense urban areas immediately. That is something that western military leaders do way too often, and it is a way to get thousands of troops needlessly gunned down. Instead, the Russians are encircling the largest Ukrainian cities. A perimeter is established which cuts off all food and supplies, and then the circle is slowly but surely squeezed tighter as the “cauldron” is relentlessly pummeled by Russian firepower.

193,"As more details emerge surrounding Hillary Clinton’s second personal email address, many are questioning whether the private emails implicate Clinton in a cover-up of several magic spells cast upon her worst enemies. The revelation of the additional account has also raised questions about Clinton’s relationship with Sydney Blumenthal, a longtime advisor and purported wizard.

One exchange between Clinton and Blumenthal, revealed earlier this year, reads:

“Fyi. The idea of using enchantment spells to arm the opposition should be considered.”

Clinton refutes that claim, saying that the email was discussing strategies to help the opposition rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and that it never read “enchantment spells,” but actually stated “private security experts.”

“The email text you are referencing is a Photoshopped internet meme,” contends Clinton.

The jury’s still out amongst voters, however, with many Republicans raising questions as to whether the practice of magic may have conflicted with her duties as Secretary of State.

“I don’t need more than one email address, but then again, I’m not a witch,” says former Florida governor, Jeb Bush. “I guess I would create a second or third email address if I was developing and casting a whole bunch of new top secret magical spells.”

THE Pentagon is calling a state of emergency this morning after social media giant, Twitter, announced it will be doubling the amount of characters users can tweet.

Military strategists and White House chiefs attended an emergency meeting late last night in preparation of the proposed plan, which theoretically increases the chances of another world war by 100%.

The San Francisco-based company said that it was doubling the length of the classic 140-character tweet to 280, at least for a few select users chosen to be part of an experimental rollout, giving the United States a brief period in which it can prepare for a series of 280 character, late night tweets from Donald Trump.

“Preferably, we would have liked more time to prepare for this,” said a Pentagon source, following the briefing, “Mr. Trump has already contacted the Twitter CEO about trying the beta version, so we’re actively trying to delay that from happening,” adding, “these are sensitive times for our country”.

Mr. Trump, who is the first US President to run all state business through the micro-blogging site, is believed to be already practising his “long form tweets”, and said on the platform last night that he is looking forward to working extra hard with the new character limit extension.

“No one said this was going to be easy,” Trump tweeted, referring to the increased workload now imposed on the US President’s thumbs, “believe me, this will be a great challenge and I may need to cancel a few trips, meetings with heads of state, health care, but I promise I will use the new Twitter character limit to the best of my ability”.

It is understood the new character limit is worth $456bn to the world economy.

More than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, and since then the vast majority have neither obtained an in-state license nor registered a motor vehicle. Conservatives say the state’s same-day registration is an invitation for fraud because of loose proof-of-residence rules. New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, a Republican, issued the numbers Thursday based on inquiries he made to the Department of State, which oversees elections, and the Department of Safety.

Here are the numbers:

⦁ 6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses. ⦁ As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire driver’s licenses. ⦁ Οf the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire. New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license. But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later.

It is well known that people are bussed in to vote in New Hampshire. This is why the Democrats are fiercely working to stop any investigation into vote fraud and are working to prevent any type of voter I.D. laws. Strict laws would have tipped New Hampshire in Donald Trump’s favor.",Fake

To me, it still allows people to get healthcare. But I urge you to join me in supporting AHCA, as I believe this bill takes a giant and much-needed step in our direction by eventually sending many more people in my direction.”

The surprise endorsement was announced Thursday, and without much fanfare, during a briefing by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer:

SPICER: Good morning. One update on the American Health Care Act. Support for this landmark legislation continues to grow. It now has the backing of House and Senate Republican leadership, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Cancer, Grover Nordquist, and medical device manufacturers. Questions?

CNN: Sean, what’s the next… wait, did you just say the bill has the support of ‘Cancer?’

SPICER: Yes. And the Chamber of Commerce and medical device manufacturers.

AP: Right, but Cancer? You don’t mean the American Cancer Society?

SPICER: Um… no. No, I believe they’re opposed. I can get back to you on that.

AP: No, that’s all right. So… Cancer endorses this bill.

SPICER: Yes. The President strongly believes that everyone should have a seat at the table and he has been negotiating with a very diverse group of interested parties, including Cancer, which said it particularly likes dropping the individual mandate.

NYT: Because… fewer people will end up with health coverage?

SPICER: I believe that was Cancer’s primary interest. When it saw that provision, it was very excited. Spontaneously self-replicated. Literally went from a stage 3 to a stage 4.

WSJ: Sean, why would the White House want Cancer’s support when the bill is opposed by hospitals, doctors and patient groups like the AARP?

SPICER: With all due respect to them, Cancer is by far the largest patient-oriented entity on the planet. Every single day it’s in direct contact with more people than either the AMA or AARP, and the President appreciates this wide base of support.

FOX: But shouldn’t the President be against Cancer?

SPICER: No. Cancer has said some very complimentary things about the President, so the President feels obliged to be complimentary in return. As he told me just last night, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could get along with Cancer?’

FOX: But Cancer is a killer.

SPICER: Hey, there are a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?

Cancer could not be reached for comment as no one really wanted to try.

209,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Overlooked as scandals swirl around the White House, Justice Department, CIA, EPA, and FBI, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said today it could get up to some pretty abusive shit if that’s what it takes to get a little attention around here.

“People don’t think of Fish & Wildlife as being ripe for overreach and corruption, but we can be a real hotbed of intrigue,” insisted regional director Brian Wills-Perry. “We’ve never been asked to hack into phones or doctor crowd photos or attack Yemen, but we could do other stuff. You give me a drone and I can blow a hole in a rainbow trout, no problem.

“I wouldn’t, of course,” he quickly added. “That would be horrible. Animals are our friends. But we could, is what I’m saying, so how about a little media scrutiny for the old U.S. FS&W?”

As part of the Interior Department, the Wildlife Service faces steep budget cuts under the Trump administration, reductions that have been all but ignored by the press, which is focused on scandals at larger agencies. Susan Kaldek, assistant director of the migratory birds division, said the media is really missing a big story by discounting the department’s controversial work on surveillance.

“I’ll bet you didn’t know, because reporters weren’t doing their jobs, that just last year we searched a marmoset den without a warrant,” Kaldek admitted. “And every fall and spring, we capture thousands of foreign nationals. Specifically Canadian Geese. And when I say ‘captured’ I mean in photos. God they’re majestic…

“But the point is, you think our borders are porous in terms of people getting through? Look up, my friend. No wall is going to keep out a great blue heron,” she added.

Fish and Aquatic Conservation director Jim Freeman, meanwhile, said the Wildlife Service is not above a security leak.

“So the FBI leaks Russian contacts and the CIA leaks entire conversations, but what if I told you we’re working on a follow-up to our 2010 report, ‘Early Life Stage Mortality Rates of Lake Sturgeon in the Peshtigo River’ in Wisconsin?” he said. “And what if that ‘accidentally’ got into the hands of Field & Stream a few weeks early? Jake Tapper will be all over my ass.”

Late this afternoon, with the media still focused elsewhere, Freeman was seen carrying a snowy egret, a small staple gun, and a migratory tag out onto the National Mall.

“I’ll do it! I’ll incorrectly tag this egret in a sensitive part of its brilliant white plumage!” shouted Freeman, tears running down his face.

“He will, he’s crazy!” Freeman added, speaking out of the side of his mouth in hopes onlookers would think the egret said it.

Election Season 2016

Ruth Bader Ginsberg was nominated to the highest court in the nation by then-President Bill Clinton in 1993. Donald Trump was a reality TV show star and real estate figure, with a worldwide string of hotels.

During the election season, when Ginsberg was asked about then-candidate Trump, she responded: “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president … For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” [The New York Times, “Ruth Bader Ginsburg, no fan of Donald Trump, critiques latest term,” July 10, 2016.] A few days later she doubled down on her comments and went even further, calling him a ‘faker’, expressing disbelief that he had not released his tax returns, and saying “he really has an ego.” [CNN]

Candidate Trump then commented on her comments in a New York Times interview, saying, “I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly … I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it… That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.” He then followed up his comments with a tweet calling on her to resign.

On her part, Ginsberg then released a statement expressing regret and acknowledging the importance of apolitical behavior for justices, and said, “In the future, I will be more circumspect.”

Indeed, it is historically unusual for a Supreme Court justice to give a personal opinion on any political candidate or process.

The Trump Presidency and Replacement Debate

President Trump took office in January of 2017, at which time Justice Ginsberg had been serving for 23 years. After the election, things between the President and the Justice were relatively quiet. Ginsberg had several trips to the hospital and her health began declining, spurring a debate about the Constitutionality of when and with whom to replace her, were she to pass away before the end of President Trump’s term.

When Justice Ginsberg did pass in September of 2020, it was reportedly her dying wish that her replacement not come until the new president had been sworn in. Many opinions on both sides of the aisle were expressed by a myriad of public figures and politicians, and 200-year-old letters by Presidents were unearthed and interpreted. When the time came for the sitting President to make a decision, he chose to disregard both that historical analysis and the justice’s last words, and expressed doubt in the veracity of Ginsberg’s reported dying wish. After releasing a statement heralding Ginsberg as a ‘titan of the law’ who ‘led an amazing life, he then gave an interview in which he made clear his intention to replace her, stating that he believed that the report that Ginsberg did not wish to be replaced until the next Presidential term (remember, at this point, the election had not been held, so the next President was not yet decided) was a fabrication authored by Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.

President Trump went on to nominate Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor, who was confirmed by a purely partisan vote.",Fake

NEW YORK — Back safely in Trump Towers after a harrowing 2-hour visit to devastatingly flooded Louisiana, Donald Trump announced a huge humanitarian gesture late this afternoon.

He ordered his private 747 to be loaded up with Make America Great Again hats in the full range of color options and flown immediately back to Baton Rouge.

“I always help everybody. I mean, I really help. I help so much it’s incredible,” said Trump in a series of tweets earlier today.

“And today I saw a lot of sad Louisians who need help. I could see it in their eyes. I’m very good at reading people’s eyes,” Trump continued in a tweet.

“And I noticed a lot of heads without hats. Sad. And some people are saying I flew in just for a photo op. The media is so dishonest. Terrible. Awful.”

“And some people are saying I should help. The governor John Bel Edwards…a Democrat by the way…said I should help or stay the heck away. Not a nice man. Mean.” “So I’m helping. My jet will leave within a few hours filled with thousands of hats. Tens of thousands of hats. They’re great hats. The best hats ever, some people are saying.”

“Those poor, wet Louisians will have Make America Great Hats by tomorrow. Lots of them. I always help everybody.”

New Trump Campaign Chief Executive Stephen Bannon told the N.Y. Times that the hats will be available at the reduced price of $29.99 and there will be a limited supply of Trump Pence t-shirts available.

“Oh! What has this administration come to?” he cried.

White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci had reportedly called a meeting with Sessions Thursday evening to ask him to resign his position as Attorney General, which he refused to do.
