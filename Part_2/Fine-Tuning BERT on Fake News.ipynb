      "\n",
      "It seems everyday there is a new risk to being a firefighter. Chemicals found on fire scenes and absorbed into turnout gear have been linked to many illness. Now a chemical found in fire hose is raising an alarm.\n",
      "\n",
      "A newly published scientific study in the Journal of Chemical Reaction and Human Hazards in Extreme Workplace Environments, sheds light on this new chemical danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the study…\n",
      "\n",
      "Dihydrogen Monoxide is a colorless and odorless chemical compound. At room temperatures it is a non-viscous liquid, but at high temperatures as found in fires it can turn into a vapor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inhalation of Dihydrogen Monoxide can cause respiratory distress. Death will result from an excessive amount being inhaled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exposure to the vapor from Dihydrogen Monoxide will cause burns. Again death is a possibility with an excessive exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire hoses release Dihydrogen Monoxide during normal firefighting operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researchers offered no recommendations on dealing with the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide. There have been no long term studies to check the effects Dihydrogen Monoxide contact has with human and the likely hood of it triggering other illnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "More studies on the effects of Dihydrogen Monoxide will be needed to find out the full extent of the danger to firefighters.\n",
      "With the exceptions of capitalism, God, and low taxes, there is nothing that Democrats detest more than having to address questions about Seth Rich. That is because the sharpest investigators from the best forensics colleges have detected a cover-up. Signs that the DNC is mired in this guilt all the way up to their neckties and pearl necklaces mean nothing to most liberals who just say, “it was proven as fake news.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, no it certainly was and is not! In fact, a paper trail has unveiled a new twist regarding the whole affair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disobedient Media tells us today that “a report from America First Media Group appears to show” that payments were made to a private security company called “Crowdstrike” and that these ominous payments “coincided with the dates of two mysterious deaths.” That would be the deaths of Seth Rich (DNC staffer and likely leaker to Wikileaks) as well as “process server Shawn Lucas.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many who care about justice remember the name of Rich, but few recall the odd facts surrounding the death of Lucas. He met his end “after he attempted to serve former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz with papers regarding the DNC Fraud Lawsuit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyers for the plaintiffs in that case “sought protection from the court” by “citing both Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas’ deaths, as well as that of Beranton Whisenant Jr. and others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "To put this into perspective, most people have seen crime documentaries where the guilty party says, “no comment” to questions like “did you kill your best friend?” There is no doubt of the guilt when such answers are given to such easy questions, and this is basically the analogy that can be used to describe how citing such concerns highlighted this.\n",
      "\n",
      "America First Media Group shows that the first payment made was what they called “preemptive measures” and occurred on May 5th, 2016. Whoever left his paper trail also later added to that a payment to Crowdstrike that totaled “$98,849.84” and that “took place on July 11th.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The report tells us that “the relationship to this date happens to be the day after DNC Data Director of New Voter Registration Seth Rich was murdered. The final payment to date is August 3rd, 2016. This coincides with another murder in the District of Columbia. Shawn Lucas, who died on August 2nd of last year, was the DNC Process Server and close friend of Seth Rich.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Are we seeing evidence of actual blood money RIGHT BEFORE OUR VERY EYES?\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucas and Rich were friends, a fact which must not be overlooked. If one of those two was suspected of telling the other anything that the DNC wanted to be left unsaid, according to the “James Bond” logic that we seem to be witnessing, they both would have to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the Atlantic Council, George “America LAST” Soros is tied to Crowdstrike, which is yet another strike against them. Also, Adam Carter has found reasons to suspect the firm as having a “possible role in the creation of the Guccifer 2.0 persona and possible fabrication of Russian hacking in coordination with the DNC.” This is a lie which has haunted the current White House since day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we have here is a rare and vivid look into actual liberal corruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "If for any reason anyone on either side of the aisle (love Trump or hate him) still thinks that there is no leftwing cover-up happening here: let us imagine that George W. Bush and his team had such a paper trail after a GOP leaker is murdered who was talking to Jullian Assange about a Republican scheme to steal the White House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with the facts that we have now, Bush would have swung from the highest tree that the media could have hung him from. Even if it was only half-true, the media circus would have savored the ratings talking about it nonstop. “A PAPER TRAIL OF DEATH FOR BUSH” the headlines on CNN would read, would they not have?\n",

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump, in an appearance on Fox News this week, accused a CNN news crew of stealing his wallet during his 2020 presidential campaign rally in Florida last Saturday. “Let me tell you, these people are very dishonest,” the President told Shepard Smith on Tuesday. “They came to me asking for a soundbite and the next thing – the next thing you know, my wallet is gone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "President Trump described the wallet as a brown leather passcase from his own Signature Collection and said at the time of the theft he was carrying it in the right pocket of his sports coat. “These people have their own agenda; they can’t be trusted. You look at CNN and the fake stories they put out, it’s sick what these people will do for ratings,” Trump charged before adding that the Secret Service is spearheading an investigation into the incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "While refusing to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, President Trump told Fox News he has ordered Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to personally lead the inquiry into his wallet’s whereabouts. “Believe me, this is very, very serious and we’re going to get to the bottom of it,” Trump vowed. “You’re going to start hearing things very soon.” The President went on to say that at the time of the alleged theft, the contents of his wallet included a billfold of approximately five thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills and a copy of the nuclear launch codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sources close to President Trump say he rarely ventures out without his Donald J. Trump Signature Collection passcase wallet. Designed for the discerning entrepreneur, the leather wallet features an emboldened gold logo and comes equipped with a bill compartment, three credit card pockets, and ample storage space. A presidential profile piece published by The New York Times on Wednesday provided a brief description of the high-end wallet, saying it contained “a pocket-sized photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin and no cash.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“These lines? These crow’s feet? This is what all the fake news about Russia and Putin is doing to me! I have crow’s feet! And my hair has totally lost its bounce and sheen!” Kushner said emotionally before pointing out the bags under his mahogany eyes.\n",

      "Kushner serves as Senior Advisor to the President — his father-in-law Donald Trump — and is currently embroiled in multiple investigations into Russian manipulation of the 2016 federal election.

      "\n",
      "The whispers are growing louder that President Donald Trump may be suffering some sort of mental decline and cognitive impairment – and his longtime pal Roger Stone thinks it’s a conspiracy. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has known the president for years, has been suggesting on air that Trump is suffering from mental decline and possibly even dementia. Stone, who has known the president for decades and claims to remain in close contact, told InfoWars founder Alex Jones the concerns about Trump’s mental state were part of a plot to remove him from the White House, reported Mediaite. “They are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimer’s…and that is the source of his insanity,” Stone told Jones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look, Alex – I’ve known Donald Trump for many years now and during that time I’ve gotten very close with him,” Stone said. “Just like you’re able to tell when your mother or father or some other family member or friend you spend a lot of time with starts to change in any way, I’m also able to tell you all of Donald’s little habits, mannerisms, quirky gestures he makes when he speaks and even predict what he’s going to say and how he’s going to behave depending on his mood. As a matter of fact, I’d even go so far as to say that the man is more like a brother to me than a friend. And like I said, when you’ve spent that much time with someone and gotten to know virtually everything about them, it’s very easy to tell if and when they start behaving oddly. You know what I mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Stone continued, “I’m telling you right here and now – it’s all one huge conspiracy to get people to believe Donald is unfit for duty and get him out of the White House. It’s the only option they have left, since they couldn’t beat him the normal way. Donald Trump does not have Alzheimer’s, dementia or whatever else they’re saying he’s suffering from.” Jones asked, “But look, I hear you, I get what you’re saying and I’m on your side, but you have to admit – he’s not a young man anymore, he’s 70 years old and he’s continuously been exposed to huge amounts of stress on a daily level for decades. Are you saying that’s not even a remote possibility?” Stone replied, “Well, that’s the thing, Alex – I’m not a doctor. I’ve spoken to him recently and he was his usual self, from what I could gather.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That being said, in my book, he’s the same, old Donald whom I’ve known for years and years. Of course, as I mentioned – I’m not a doctor or a professional, so I don’t have any medical argumentation to support my claims. But, I will say this: in the unlikely event I’m wrong and he does have a mental impairment, it’s Barack Obama’s fault. I mean, Barack Obama has attacked Donald Trump since the moment he realized that Donald was thinking about running for president – I think even before he initiated his campaign. His attacks on Donald Trump caused immense stress on a daily level because, that’s the thing – Obama had no other arguments to dispute Donald’s campaign other than to make jokes about how he’s a bad employer and how business is all he’s ever been good at. Sure, he’s not a politician, but he’s a self-made man. In my book, that’s way better than being a so-called Democrat who cares more about illegal and Muslim immigrants than he does for his own people. So, I would certainly understand if Donald has Alzheimer’s because of Barack Obama,” Stone concluded.\n",

      "\n",
      "Is there some rule out there we don’t know about that states that founders of major DIY retail chains have to get involved in politics eventually? We saw that the people behind Hobby Lobby were all too eager to jump out of their lane (craft supplies) when the moment arose, and now and it is becoming clear that they learned by watching the founder of Home Depot, who just can’t stay out of the political arena (made in part, presumably, withPremium Birrill Fir Studs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Bernie Marcus wrote a piece for Real Clear Politics to announce that he is supporting Donald Trump. Granted, he is a home improvement store founder, so no one really asked him, but he did it, we have it, and we are moving forward with the new information now. If someone were to ask me, I’d say he’s just doing the same thing people speculated Ben Carson and Chris Christie might have been doingwhen they came out in favor of Trump. In the same way there were rumors that Carson and Christie were simply gunning for a chance at being vice president or getting into Trump’s cabinet, I think Marcus just wants to make sure that if Trump gets the presidency, Home Depot becomes the Official Sponsor of the Mexico-America Wall.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A plug for the American Dream/Home Depot came first:\n",
      "\n",
      "But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners. I never forget The Home Depot’s small business roots – we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came a just-because sort of attack on media and academia:\n",
      "\n",
      "Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "That shade on media and academia came amidst glorification of the job creation inherent in the founding of small businesses. Note that Marcus took time to praise his employees who have been able to get wealthy without college degrees, but in one quick statement, took a swipe at everyone who works at a university, lab, library, newspaper, television station, etc. So, are jobs really the main focus here at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "He concluded by targeting the #NeverTrump Republicans:\n",
      "\n",
      "As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bush– and who has contributed to candidates for a generation – I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "In time, we will surely learn the political inclinations of every founder, mogul, and, in Marcus’ words, “young [man willing] to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great.” Marcus is just one of the first of many this election season.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, make repainting your living room for the ninth time because you’re so bored and lonely that it physically hurts and maybe a sea-foam green accent wall will fill the void your ex-girlfriend left great again or something.\n",

      "\n",
      "“President Trump has really enjoyed talking about the NFL and NASCAR in recent days,” said White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “He feels the best way to get out his sports takes is to go full-time into sports talk radio. The nuclear faceoff with North Korea, our wars in the Middle East and Puerto Rico being underwater were threatening to derail his opinions on standing for the national anthem at football games, and so he is stepping away from the presidency effective immediately.”\n",

      "“I feel I was able to accomplish much for the American people in my time as president,” read a statement from Trump following his resignation. “I helped America understand that the NFL is bad and that I don’t like Stephen Curry. Also, I’m told I made a Supreme Court judge. I hope the judge is not Steph Curry and is maybe one of the Pittsburgh Penguins. Please tune into Sports Radio 980: The Yakker tomorrow for more.”\n",

      "Washington, DC — During an interview today with Fox News, Donald Trump unveiled plans making it mandatory for all Muslim people and refugees entering this country, along with those currently residing in the U.S., to wear badges on their outer garments at all times. The 2016 presidential candidate says these badges are necessary so refugees and Muslims can easily be identified and monitored.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They are a danger to our Christian way of life in America, it’s that simple,” Trump said. ‘The Muslims, they want us dead, we know that for a fact. The refugees are joining ISIS and are pouring into our country like that. They both hate our freedom and way of life, you can’t argue that. By enforcing and requiring these possible terrorists to wear badges at all time they can be easily identified and tracked if necessary. This is nothing like the badges the Jews had to wear during the Holocaust, that was different, but you know, it’s the same thing. These are tough times right now and I’m just saying what everyone else is too afraid to say. We can take back America, we just need to work together, it’s never too late.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump went further by saying he would put all the Muslims and refugees entering this country on their own land, with critics comparing that to Hitler’s concentration camps during World War II.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no reason we shouldn’t put them all on their own land like how we did with the Indians. We know what these people are capable of and I know I’m scared, and I know most Americans are too. We need to act now before more innocent lives are lost.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week Trump told various news sources he would implement databases to track every Syrian refugee, Muslim and mosque in this country.\n",

      "\n",
      "Appearing Sunday on ABC’s “This Week”, Trump was asked about the databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want a database for the refugees,” Trump said. “We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don’t know if they’re ISIS, we don’t know if it’s a Trojan horse. And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "President Obama has expanded the usual annual ceiling for refugees of 70,000 by an additional 15,000, with 10,000 of those new slots for Syrians. At the outset, officials said this program for Syrian refugees probably would continue beyond one year. But nothing approaching 250,000, which Trump routinely says, is in the works.\n",

      "Historians of the Third Reich and Nazi Holocaust say that these methods of government control paved the way for the acceptance of the Holocaust by German citizens.\n",

      "“The German government’s policy of forcing Jews to wear identifying badges was but one of many psychological tactics aimed at isolating and dehumanizing the Jews of Europe, directly marking them as being different and inferior to everyone else,” Paul Horner of the Holocaust Center said. “It allowed for the easier facilitation of their separation from society and subsequent ghettoization, which ultimately led to the deportation and murder of 6 million Jews. What Donald Trump is doing is just the beginning, exactly how Hitler started out. More hate and ignorance is definitely what we don’t need in this country right now.” Horner continued, “The only thing good coming from all of this, is that Trump is keeping comedy writers employed and making cash. This stupid moron is a wet dream for writers of comedy all around the world; it’s not even fair. He writes the story himself, you just have to report what he did and said and your job is done. I truly hope he gets the Republican nomination, we need to keep this cash cow alive. He’ll lose to ANYONE that gets elected on the Democratic side, but until then, we must remember these good times and how backwards him and all of his followers are.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The yellow badges that were given to the Jews by the Nazis, was a cloth patch sewn on their outer garments that marked them as Jews in public. Intended or not, it served as a badge of shame, making them easily identifiable.\n",

      "Many unanswered questions remain about the 2016 U.S. President Election in which Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton. The election was controversial and divisive on social media, where true and false political gossip was widely spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the countless election memes that were circulated online gave the impression that three years earlier Hillary Clinton made a statement to bankers the nation needed a business leader such as Trump as president.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Did Hillary Supposedly Say About Trump?\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2016 an infographic spread on social media that Hillary Clinton said the following in 2013: “I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; they’re honest and can’t be bought.” Accompanying the quote was a photo of Donald standing next to Hillary, which was taken at the future president’s wedding to Melania in 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump and Clinton Relationship\n",
      "\n",
      "It should come as no surprise that either the Trump or Clinton families would say something nice about the other, as the two families became friends during Bill Clinton’s White House years. Trump praised and defended President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He also had positive things to say about Hillary in interviews when she ran for president the first time in 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after the extremely negative 2016 campaign from both parties, Trump still spoke highly of the Clintons when they attended his inaugural luncheon in 2017, saying he had great respect for them. Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton particularly have had a close friendship over the years. Photos also show Donald Trump at a golf course with Bill Clinton.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it’s not hard to believe that it would be very possible for Hillary to praise family friend Donald Trump three years before anyone knew what to expect about Obama’s successor.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Fact-Checkers Say\n",
      "\n",
      "The meme was debunked by fact-check sites and several major news sources that identified the origin of the fake quote as a discontinued Israel-based website. The website’s “About Us” page clarified the site mixed news with satire. Interestingly, several other satire sites were taken as fact during the election, leading to what could be argued as the biggest spread of political misinformation in the history of propaganda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Factcheck.org and Politifact rate the quote as false – meaning it wasn’t a real quote by Hillary, as it apparently was meant as satirical humor. It’s no more true than saying Donald Trump made Mike Pence wear a training collar throughout his Presidency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closest thing Hillary said to the fake quote during her actual speech was “You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office.” She went on to say “you don’t have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom.” She never mentioned Trump at all in the entire speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "The website claimed Hillary made a positive comment about Trump on October 29, 2013, at Goldman Sachs. Even though she actually did speak to the investment firm on that date, the transcript revealed the quote in question was nowhere to be found. The transcript of that speech was posted online by WikiLeaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "As much as some people want to believe Hillary promoted Donald Trump for President in a 2013 speech, the quote was fabricated by a hybrid news/satire website. It’s one of many examples of how satire or another form of entertainment can be confused as truth for some people.\n",

      "Democrats argue that the GOP fixation on voter fraud is all about denying some citizens the right to vote, meanwhile Republicans argue that the Democrats near-monolithic defense of voter fraud is all about winning extra votes. Both arguments have merit, but the Democrats are lying when they pretend that the problem simply doesn’t exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every election there are countless examples of voter fraud (sometimes even mass voter fraud) that come to light, and this election has been no different.

      "In New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton won the vote by the slimmest of margins. Less than 3K votes separated the two candidates.

      "\n",
      "State law requires that anyone moving to the state must acquire a new driver’s license within 60 days of establishing residency, but more than 5K 2016 voters have still not done that, leading authorities to believe that these were fraudulent voters who came to the state to influence the outcome of the election.\n",

      "Of the 5,313 individuals who registered to vote same-day on Election Day, 81 percent – 4,314 people – neither held a New Hampshire driver’s license nor had a registered vehicle in the state ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the exception of the gubernatorial race – where Republican Chris Sununu easily bested Democrat Colin Van Ostern by more than 16,000 votes – Democrats won all the other statewide and Congressional races.\n",
      "\n",
      "But three races were determined by less than 5,000 votes: Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, beat incumbent U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes – although many have suspected that last minute, illegal campaign mailers pushing votes to independent Aaron Day cost Ayotte the race. Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by 2,736, earning the state’s 4 Electoral College votes even though she ultimately lost the presidency. U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter was sent back to Congress after she bested incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta by a few more than 4,900 votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the grand scheme of things 5K fraudulent votes in a nation of 315 million people may not seem like much, but in a state where 3 of the most important races were decided by less than 5K votes, it’s monumental. Consider the failed Obamacare repeal vote; could Senator Kelly Ayotte have helped the GOP ram repeal through? Or how much help could Rep. Frank Guinta be giving the House GOP if he’d actually defeated his liberal opponent?\n",
      "\n",
      "The state government must continue its investigation and these fraudulent voters must be brought to justice. Voter fraud is a felony and it should be investigated and prosecuted as such.\n",

I just saw my visionary infrastructure plan that would create jobs for millions of Americans like a week ago—maybe it’s in the car? Couldn’t hurt to look there at this point.” At press time, Kushner was still unable to locate his notes for dissuading his father-in-law from taking such a soft stance toward neo-Nazism but ultimately decided he wasn’t too excited about that project anyway.\n",

      "First it was Obama Care, Obama Phones, Obama Weed and now Obama Gas. Yes, you heard that right. The White House has quietly used a provision in the law to roll out a nationwide program of free gas for the poor. According to The Detroit News, the Obama administration is using its authority under the Affordable Care Act to “improve transportation routes to hospitals”. This would make it possible for welfare recipients to receive these preloaded gas cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a $2 billion a year program that will distribute 40 million gallons of gasoline for FREE each year. It will be dispensed at any gas station that participates in the program by accepting this form of payment. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be operating the network. Over 3,000 gas stations in 38 states have been approved to accept this payment in their stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dori Salcido, assistant DHHS Sec. for Public Affairs explained, “It is not something we are publicizing very much, for obvious reasons. But under the law we are well within our rights to offer this service and we think it’s good public policy. How are people supposed to get to the doctors office if they don’t have gas in their cars? Health insurance is worthless if you can’t make it to your appointments. This is just another fine example of government stepping in and solving big problems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This type of program has worked well in oil-rich nations like Venezuela and Indonesia where they subsidize gas for the poor. However, this practice has never been tried here in the United States. This is causing much controversy with some taxpayers who are upset to see their money subsidizing others. One taxpayer, Ross Blake, shared his thoughts, “So basically I’m being punished for not living in the ghetto. I have three kids and a mortgage. Life isn’t cheap for me either. I could use some free gasoline too.” A person like Blake will unlikely be able to use this service.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Access to this gas card is determined by income,” says Ebony Jackson, a caseworker at he Department of Health and Human Services. “If you are receiving food stamps or cash assistance from the government, you will be approved. All you need to do is apply. The card will supply anywhere from $50 per month to $150 per month in free gas depending on the individual’s income. If they have no income, benefits will max out at $250 per month. This will help the unemployed person go to and from job interviews.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The gas card scandal was uncovered by Nolan Finley, a conservative Detroit News columnist widely known for his groundbreaking exposé on Obama Phones. Finley says, “There is a blatant economical bias in the program and that is only one of its many outrageous aspects. The President is only trying to increase his popularity. This is something you normally only see in Third World countries. I’ve never been more scared for our democracy.”\n",

      "The Russians are employing the exact same tactics that we witnessed in Syria and during the two Chechen wars, but the mainstream media doesn’t seem to understand this. Up to this point, the mainstream media has used the fact that many major Ukrainian cities have not yet fallen as evidence that the war is not going too well for Russia. But the truth is that the Russians did not intend to recklessly send their forces into dense urban areas immediately. That is something that western military leaders do way too often, and it is a way to get thousands of troops needlessly gunned down. Instead, the Russians are encircling the largest Ukrainian cities. A perimeter is established which cuts off all food and supplies, and then the circle is slowly but surely squeezed tighter as the “cauldron” is relentlessly pummeled by Russian firepower.

      "(Natural News) New EPA rules are being implemented on heavy trucks which has boosted the 10-year regulatory burden on America past the $1 trillion mark. 75 percent of that cost was imposed by the Obama administration. New analysis from American Action Forum shows that the cost amounts to an annual cost of $540 per person, or a one-time charge of $3,080.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In other words, each year every person, regardless of age, in the nation is responsible for paying roughly $540 in regulatory costs. These burdens might take the form of higher prices, fewer jobs, or reduced wages,” said AAF’s Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the watchdog group.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Obama is scrambling to lock in several new environmental regulations prior to leaving office. Obama has shattered the record for the amount of regulations and added red tape this year, and he still has time to impose many more before leaving office. The staggering amount of money he is costing America is likely to surge even higher. The implementation of new fuel standards for trucks resulted in the new high regulatory costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Batkins’ study dates back to 2005, when George W Bush held the oval office. He said that the Obama administration is responsible for about three-quarters of the added regulatory costs. “The Obama Administration surpassed 500 major regulations last summer, imposing $625 billion in cumulative costs. Earlier this year, regulators published the administration’s 600th major rule, increasing burdens to $743 billion. Now, thanks to data from the last term of the Bush Administration and another billion-dollar rule from EPA, the regulatory tally has surpassed $1 trillion. These figures are direct estimates from federal regulators, but it will take more than an effort from these regulators to amend hundreds of major regulations. Congress, the next president, and even the courts must participate in the next generation of regulatory modernization.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The EPA wants to make it very difficult for the Trump administration to align fuel economy standards with the needs and expectations of Americans. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has urged the agency’s employees to quickly finish as many rules as possible before Obama leaves the White House. The EPA reported last month that automakers exceeded fuel efficiency standards in new cars, but were unhappy with the agency’s early release of its fuel efficiency study.\n",

      "Washington D.C. (10:00 A.M. EST)—Addressing the media this morning, White House Spokesperson Sean Spicer confirmed reports that President Trump has recommitted himself to learning the English alphabet between signing executive orders. “The President has worked his way up to ‘R’ and continues to learn new, interesting letters each day for the American people,” said Spicer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Trump has publicly stated his support for the current alphabet, a leaked draft executive order tentatively titled “Make the Alphabet Great Again” contained an order “suspending the letter ‘H’ from existence until we can figure out what’s going on.” Trump had campaigned on a promise to learn the alphabet during his first one hundred days in office.\n",
      "Iraq War Veteran Dies Trying to Protect Buffet Ice Cream Machine from Obese Woman Home just eight weeks after being wounded during his second tour in Iraq, Javier Rodriguez of Macon, Georgia died in a valiant attempt to protect the financial solvency of his new employer from the gluttony of an overweight customer when he inserted himself between the soft serve ice cream machine at a Country House Buffet restaurant and a four hundred pound woman Thursday afternoon. According to official reports, Rodriguez, a non-US citizen who served eighteen months in Iraq before being discharged after sustaining the ill-effects of a concussive blast in January, died almost immediately from trauma he received from Jessica Clark of nearby Glenhaven when he attempted to repel the morbidly obese woman’s seventh trip back to the all-you-can-eat restaurant’s dessert bar. “Soon as he done it I said to myself, ‘That boy’s got a screw loose standin’ between a fat lady and her sundae cart like that',” described one eyewitness, “But even though he looked real scared, he stood his ground and started begging her, saying ‘Please lady no’, and something about having a wife and kid to feed at home as the big fat cow started mooing, going, 'moooo', 'moooo', louder and louder until I realize she’s saying ‘move’, but he wouldn’t back down. I aint never seen nothin' braver.” After an estimated 30 second stand-off, Clark struck Rodriguez over the head with a clubbed fist, then stomped his prone body once before pouring a seventh large bowl of vanilla-chocolate swirl ice cream topped with hot fudge, brownie bits, M&Ms, peanuts and rainbow jimmies which she consumed inside of three minutes, well before the police arrived. Commented Country House Buffet manager Chuck Patterson, “For Javier it was not only about protecting the business he depended upon to provide for his family. It was something more. There was something about witnessing a very overweight person sweat while consuming fifteen fried fish filets, three pounds of lasagna and a gallon of clam chowder in one sitting that his sense of honor couldn’t abide by.” Continued Patterson: “But I blame myself. I shouldn’t have told him what a predicament these people were putting our restaurant in. I should have known he’d try something like this.” In view of Rodriguez’s immigration status and the fact that he will not qualify for the attendant benefits a possible posthumous conferral of citizenship by the US government would bring if he had died in combat, friends and family are humbly requesting donations for a memorial service be sent to P.O. Box 2360, Macon, Georgia\n",

      "Bill O’Reilly: “Companies Under Trump Must Say ‘Merry Christmas’ Or Will Be Forced To “Send Employees To Religious Classes”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all the voices crusading against the so-called “War on Christmas,” perhaps no TV personality has lent their star power to the fight against encroaching secular influence that Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has. On Thursday, the O’Reilly Factor host called out the “companies that kind of marginalized Christmas” this year by failing to use the word in their holiday advertisements and promotions, including Best Buy, Barnes & Noble and Victoria’s Secret. “Those companies are not in the Christmas spirit,” O’Reilly complained. “And that’s bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The pundit argued that the companies in question will be “forced to send employees to religious classes” if they continue to avoid greeting their customers with the words “Merry Christmas.” “They’ve got a lot of nerve,” he said. “The vast majority of the people that frequent their stores are Christians, traditional Americans and people who respect and honor these sort of traditions. And when you, as a company that’s making money directly off of your customers, refuse to adopt the same values and traditions as your market, you’re done. I know it sounds cruel, but that’s just the name of the game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And while we’re on the subject,” O’Reilly continued, “that’s also one of the things I have a problem with in American society as of late. We’re a nation of immigrants, bla bla bla, everybody already knows the whole story. However, the whole point of America is, we’re supposed to be always accepting new immigrants, which we’re doing, by the boatloads, but at the same time, we’re also supposed to be assimilating them into American society. After a period of time, they’re supposed to become Americans, not stay whatever they were before they came here. And that also goes for religion, as well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The host also added, “And before someone calls me up and accuses me of being bigoted, let me just say that I don’t think all naturalized Americans should be Christians. Everybody here is completely entitled to their own religious freedom. However, that doesn’t change the fact that the majority of the people born in this country are, in fact, Christians. And given that it’s our country, not that of our immigrant new citizens – we ought to be greeted with ‘Merry Christmas’ when we walk into the aforementioned stores to spend our hard earned money. And when our immigrant citizens greet us there as part of their jobs, they should remember that they came to work to America, not the other way around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if the aforementioned companies don’t start instructing their employees to use ‘Merry Christmas’ as an official greeting soon, they are going to be forced to send their employees off to religious training lessons and classes, where they will be trained in everything Christianity stands for. And that’s going to be the hard way to solve this problem, since the easy way is not likely to work – I can see that even now. So, either companies teach their off-the-books immigrant workers to pronounce the words ‘Merry Christmas’ when they see a white American person walking into their store, or Uncle Sam is going to do it for them. And trust me, guys – you’re not going to like what Uncle Sam has planned. I can’t tell you all the details, but I’m fairly certain it’ll include the words ‘water’ and ‘boarding’ at some point,” O’Reilly concluded.\n",
      "RICHMOND, Va. – An updated version of the twenty-dollar bill featuring the American Confederate general Robert E. Lee is scheduled to make its debut in a handful of southern states later this month, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Treasury announced on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. “We are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas,” Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to replace the existing twenty-dollar banknote, which entered circulation in 1996, comes as President Donald J. Trump continues to work diligently to reverse his predecessor’s policies. “We had Barack Obama, who – for eight years and without any prior authorization from Congress – decided he was going to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “Well, Wolf, he can’t do that,” Conway argued, continuing, “President Trump cares very deeply about the American people and he has said, time and time again, if we’re going to do it, we’ll replace one great man with another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Less than a week after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pointedly avoided voicing support for a $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing – the agency responsible for producing paper currency – released a statement saying “current color and shading capabilities limit our ability to adequately depict [Harriet Tubman] on most forms of U.S. currency.” The statement went on to say that increased shading would make the bill “too dark” and, therefore, more susceptible to counterfeiting.\n",

The cake was beautifully decorated using green sprinkles with a chemical aroma.Comey’s secretary Amber Smith confirmed the cake had been received, along with a short note from the President. The note reads:According to Smith, it is uncertain exactly what kind of cake this is. “It appears to be a chocolate cake but I have no idea what the green sprinkles are made of. Perhaps they’re pistachio or mint flavour.”Smith continued, explaining that, unfortunately, Mr Comey was unable to eat the cake. He was very pleased to receive such a lovely gift but, “just as he was about to cut himself a piece, he suddenly spotted three dead flies lying on it so he had to throw it away. It’s a shame about the chocolate, though.”Read the German version HERE\n",

      "“The fact that he was able to hold out for nearly 20 minutes without grabbing her is a testament to the kind of man, husband and feminist Mike is,” President Trump later told reporters. “God knows I would have cracked inside 60 seconds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to CCTV the woman did attempt to dash out of the elevator once the VP entered, as is standard White House protocol for all female staff, but she was too late. The video shows the Vice President remained calm initially, casually ordering the woman to stand in one corner of the elevator and stare at her feet, with him doing the same in the opposite end. However, disaster struck once the elevator jerked to an abrupt stop and technicians informed the pair it could be up to 30 minutes before they would be freed.\n",

For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” [The New York Times, “Ruth Bader Ginsburg, no fan of Donald Trump, critiques latest term,” July 10, 2016.] A few days later she doubled down on her comments and went even further, calling him a ‘faker’, expressing disbelief that he had not released his tax returns, and saying “he really has an ego.” [CNN]\n",

I couldn’t believe it when I saw it… That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more.

After the election, things between the President and the Justice were relatively quiet. Ginsberg had several trips to the hospital and her health began declining, spurring a debate about the Constitutionality of when and with whom to replace her, were she to pass away before the end of President Trump’s term.\n",

      "When Justice Ginsberg did pass in September of 2020, it was reportedly her dying wish that her replacement not come until the new president had been sworn in. Many opinions on both sides of the aisle were expressed by a myriad of public figures and politicians, and 200-year-old letters by Presidents were unearthed and interpreted. When the time came for the sitting President to make a decision, he chose to disregard both that historical analysis and the justice’s last words, and expressed doubt in the veracity of Ginsberg’s reported dying wish. After releasing a statement heralding Ginsberg as a ‘titan of the law’ who ‘led an amazing life, he then gave an interview in which he made clear his intention to replace her, stating that he believed that the report that Ginsberg did not wish to be replaced until the next Presidential term (remember, at this point, the election had not been held, so the next President was not yet decided) was a fabrication authored by Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.\n",

      "Dear America,\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, it’s just getting frustrating. Time and time again, our party’s leaders have drafted and presented health care bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. We’ve tried this thing from all possible angles, but the backlash to each potential bill has been so severe that we haven’t been able to get anything passed. Where is all this negativity coming from?\n",
      "\n",
      "We had Paul Ryan take a crack at an alternative health care bill, but he blew it hard. Then, Mitch McConnell stepped up to the plate, and he also blew it hard. Now, this thing is in the hands of Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, but constituent phone calls disparaging the bill are flooding all of our offices. This has forced our party to ask the American people a very important question: do you not want us to kill a few million people or something?\n",
      "\n",
      "Look, we’re trying our best here. At any given point, we have twelve or so of our best and brightest old white men working on a health care alternative to Obamacare. A bunch of guys named Bradley and Ralph will not rest until working class Americans are screwed over real badly. It’s disheartening because we’re trying so hard, yet the American people still seem intent on rejecting any legislation we present just because a few million people might die. It’s almost like you people don’t want us to murder a huge chunk of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we were the obstructionist party for eight years and we halted as much legislation as possible. But, now that we have control of Congress, we’re hell-bent on getting stuff done. We want to pass legislation! So, why won’t the American people just let us pass a health care bill that’ll treat pregnancy like a pre-existing condition and raise premiums for sick people? It’s completely ridiculous that you won’t let us kill a lot of poor people. Is that what this is all about? The millions of people who will die because they won’t be able to afford health care if we pass one of these bills? These very negative reactions to our death bills confuse and demoralize us.\n",

      "Do you not like the name of the bill or something? Just say the word and we can have one of the Bradleys try naming the new health care bill something a bit more flashy. We just want to understand why so much skepticism is getting tossed our way. Is it all the impending death and suffering that any of these bills will entail? That can’t possibly be it. Why would so many average American citizens be against a systematic culling of the country’s working class, elderly, and disabled populations? It doesn’t make sense to us at all.\n",

Following on the heels of the wave of marijuana legalization, some might be surprised to hear that Maine state legislature has decided to legalize the popular street drug Ecstasy. Recreational use of will become fully legal in the state by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision was met with controversy but “no more or less than the original decision to legalize marijuana,” Governor Paul LePage stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state is still working out some guidelines and ground rules for suppliers, such as purity levels, permits, and health code requirements. While LePage says the vote was popular among a lot of people in the state, his decision came as a shock for many Mainers. Governor LePage did not comment on whether or not he partakes in the drug himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By legalizing, monitoring, and taxing ecstasy, we will not only cut down on inmates and care costs, it will also open up a whole new job market,” LePage explains. “It’s a good situation all around, especially for taxpayers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the most outspoken opponents, however, have been current drug dealers.\n",

      "Despite the negative press, experts estimate this legalization will drop the state’s debt by as much as 50% in the first year.

Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. “This morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. “There are a lot of obvious questions we just don’t have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We can’t be sure,” he said. “All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. “These birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden,” Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds – Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese – are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad.\n",

      "And when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now I’m not so sure.

      "It seems like it’s always on the tip of my tongue these days; that “Donald Trump is a bad man.” But I can’t bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said he’d “send me back to Slovenia” if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country.

      "Considering Obama never held a real job in his life, this is an extraordinary move:\n",
      "\n",
      "Word around the island is that the Obamas, who’ve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Martha’s Vineyard — Harvard professors Henry Louis “Skip” Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few — and they would like to own a place of their own on the island. The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused “up island,” looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (It’s worth noting that the Obamas have always rented “up island,” including for a two-week stay this summer.) No one’s talking, least of all realtors, but we’re told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market. Both are still available — but they don’t come cheap. Sotheby’s International Realty and Hancock Real Estate in Chilmark are listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million. The descriptions for each read like something out of a fairytale: “The vast acreage and exquisite dune-fringed sands give the sense of a world apart in an idyllic landscape which has remained virtually unchanged over the centuries. Perched on a southwest-facing ridge, the potential homesite commands glorious views to the ocean’s brilliant blue waters and sunsets in the midst of this sublime seaside paradise of pastoral coastal heathlands and high dunes.”\n",

      "And as shown by real estate websites, the property would be the exact wrong place to buy a home if you believe Al Gore’s predictions about rising sea levels:\n",
      "\n",
      "The lots, such as the one shown above, cost approximately $15 million… and that’s just the cost before any home is built. The luxurious properties must be built to withstand erosion of land and require unique painting to avoid damage due to the surrounding salt water. And none of that includes serious issues involving licensing, zoning, permits, and ground preparation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason to laugh at the Obamas is they may be building on top of land that was stolen from Native Americans!\n",

      "“The Obamas need to check all permits, and [see] if their land can be subdivided, and if it’s on Wampanoag land,” says Julianne Kavoussi, who has owned a home in the Edgartown part of the Vineyard for 20 years. The Wampanoag are Native American people who, she says, own a good portion of Aquinnah.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn’t long ago that we learned Al Gore’s house uses 34 times the amount of energy used by the average American household. Now, the Obamas are being the hypocrites we always knew they were.\n",

      "The Russians are employing the exact same tactics that we witnessed in Syria and during the two Chechen wars, but the mainstream media doesn’t seem to understand this. Up to this point, the mainstream media has used the fact that many major Ukrainian cities have not yet fallen as evidence that the war is not going too well for Russia. But the truth is that the Russians did not intend to recklessly send their forces into dense urban areas immediately. That is something that western military leaders do way too often, and it is a way to get thousands of troops needlessly gunned down. Instead, the Russians are encircling the largest Ukrainian cities. A perimeter is established which cuts off all food and supplies, and then the circle is slowly but surely squeezed tighter as the “cauldron” is relentlessly pummeled by Russian firepower.

      "WASHINGTON—A new report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center has found that the country that might completely shut down because the president wants a big wall is somehow considered the best in the world. The study determined that the 241-year-old federal republic, whose entire government may soon cease to function on account of the head of state’s desire for a big, tall, and thick wall stretching all the way from one side of the water to the other side of the water, remains widely viewed as an exemplary nation and the preeminent achievement in democratic governance. The report also revealed that the country continues to be regarded as a paragon of excellence and a refuge for all humanity despite its commander-in-chief risking the loss of billions of dollars in potential revenue and the termination of vital public services because he really, really wants the big concrete wall and wants it now. Researchers confirmed that this nation, which may grind to a halt due to the leader’s demand for a big, giant, cement wall, is absolutely convinced that every other nation should be just like it.\n",

      "The nuclear suitcase that is always at the president's disposal was also addressed. \"We just put baby locks on it,\" Mattis explained. \"Through direct experience with the President we have observed that if anything takes him more than two minutes to figure out he usually loses interest in.

      "Sally Quinn, now 76, is a former Washington Post (WP) reporter who became the third (and last) wife of the late WP executive editor and later, vice president, Benjamin Bradlee.

      "In 2006, Quinn wrote that her parents were religious “but didn’t go to church,” and that she was an atheist since the time she was a small child because she could not believe in a God who allowed evil and bad things to happen to people, including her (unnamed) sickness when she was ten years old.\n",

      "John Nolte reports for Breitbart, Sept 12, 2017:\n",
      "\n",
      "“For nearly 50 years, the entire social and political world of DC revolved around this couple. Bradlee and Quinn were the New Camelot (his career took off in large part because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy), the Gatekeepers of who was in and who was out, the Elite Deciders among our Ruling Class with the extraordinary power of the Washington Post, and by extension the rest of the mainstream media, to abuse and weaponize their will against the rest of us. Well, to put it as bluntly as possible, we are now learning that the Queen of Camelot is an occultist, a witch of sorts who honestly believes (according to her own new memoir) that she murdered three innocent people through the dark art of the hex: a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinn’s boyfriend; a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of her, who decades later died of cancer; a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. […] Quinn’s other acts of admitted wickedness include plotting to break up Bradlee’s marriage (which she did) and using the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quinn “practiced the occult in the most demonic ways imaginable well into adulthood.” She finally stopped hexing others, not out of a sense of remorse, but because she thought she was karmically responsible for the unusual illness of her and Bradlee’s only son, Quinn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quinn Bradlee was born in 1982 (when Sally Quinn was 41 and Ben Bradlee was 61) with a rare and incurable disease called velo-cardio-facial syndrome, aka DiGeorge syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion or Shprintzen syndrome. Caused by the deletion of a small segment (30-40 genes) of chromosome 22, the syndrome occurs in only 1 in 4,000 people with afflictions that can include congenital heart problems, specific facial features, frequent infections, developmental delay, learning problems, cleft palate, kidney problems, hearing loss, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nolte points out that what is almost as troubling as Sally Quinn’s witchcraft is “the matter-of-fact way in which the Washington Post informs us of this bombshell” under the chatty headline, ‘‘Sally Quinn’s hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son”. Nolte writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have just discovered that one of the primary movers and shakers of the last half-century is a practicing occultist, and… Nothing. Nobody cares. The information is dropped as though Quinn’s tell-all is the usual-usual about plastic surgeries and sex. Worse still, our Ruling Class is now joking about Quinn putting a deadly hex on President Trump. […] Let’s just say it out loud… The most powerful people in our country are either outright occultists, are comfortable with witchcraft and Satanism, or are moving and shaking among those who are. Whether or not you believe in the power of the occult, that does not matter. Also beside the point is whether or not the Podestas and Quinn and those calling to have Trump hexed believe. What we do know is that these people have completely rejected any notion of a loving God, and moved towards darkness. Furthermore, we also know that this darkness is not about consenting adults behaving badly amongst themselves. Rather, this is about them attempting to harness a power to control others, to manipulate events to their will, to hurt or outright kill those who offend or insult them.“\n",

I knew you and Dad were not very religious people . . . . I didn’t really understand that you didn’t believe in God until a few years ago. I didn’t know what ‘atheist’ meant. It’s a very harsh word, very ugly word. It’s like calling a black person the “N” word. . . . Everything happens for a reason. Maybe it’s God’s plan for me to go through this because I can handle it. . . . In a way, believing in God is like having a girlfriend that you love and care about. You feel safe with her. You feel safe with God, the way you would with your girlfriend. When you get married she will be with you in sickness and in health. That’s what I believe God will do when I’m going through the hard times of life.”\n",

      "The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.\n",

      "“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.\n",

      "When Obama is out of office it will be interesting to see what they put in his “Library” regarding his early years. In a country where we take notice of many facets of our public figures’ lives, doesn’t it seem odd that there’s so little we know about our current man in the White House, Barack Obama?\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, we know that Andrew Jackson’s wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery. Abe Lincoln never went to school. Jack Kennedy wore a back brace. Harry Truman played the piano.\n",

The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all know about JFK’s magnetism; that McCain was no monk; quite a few details about Palin’s courtship and even her athletic prowess; Joe Biden’s aneurisms are no secret; look at Cheney and Clinton — we all know about their heart problems.

      "\n",

      "This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man. Have you seen a movie named “The Manchurian Candidate” ? It is a classic, and it is pertinent.\n",

It’s the now famous “covfefe” message that fools (Proverbs 10:21) fail to understand. President Trump , as always, knows what He is doing. The explanations by the biased liberal press are revealing but useless. Quote: It’s a good guess that the word he was looking for was “ coverage .” But the tweet, and the thought, remained incomplete. Within two hours, it had been retweeted more than 60,000 times and “liked” more than 74,000 times — making it one of his most popular tweets in months. Our True Christian™ Department of Biblical Linguistics at the Landover Baptist University (Lamentations Flint Memorial Building) do acknowledge that the sentence would make secular sense with the word “coverage” as follows: “Despite the constant negative press coverage”. But that is old alternative news. President Trump has moved beyond the mortal realm of mundane worries. We were certain that the message would contain a Biblical message and after careful scrutiny we are happy to announce that is does!\n",

      "Washington (dpo) - That man does nothing by half measures. On Friday President Donald Trump announced the USA’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and today news has already surfaced that the power supply to the White House has been entirely converted to run on fossil fuels.White House spokesperson Sean Spicer announced the conversion at a press conference strewn with billowing smoke. “The President is leading by example,” yelled Spicer over the noise of the generators. Coughing, he continued, “from now on, the White House will run exclusively on the energy of the future.”Central heating and hot water will be heated by coal fired power stations and a miniature lignite fired power station will provide the electricity supply. At times of short supply, 38 diesel generators can provide additional power. Experts believe that the fast growing levels of soot will soon require the White House to be renamed the Gray House.Figures were already available showing that energy consumption at the White House have increased by 200% since Trump took office. According to a statement from the White House, this is because, “the President doesn’t like it too hot or too cold so the central heating and air conditioning system are both permanently running at full capacity”.According to Spicer, the Trump government’s medium term goal is to put in place targeted measures to foster non-renewable energies so that by 2020, all American households are supplied in a similar manner.“Now you’ll have to excuse me”, said Sean Spicer in closing, “I have to go and shovel 73 wheelbarrows of coal for this evening. The President likes to take hot baths.”Read the German version HERE\n",
      "WEEKEND WHITE HOUSE, BEDMINSTER, N.J. In what appears to be a throwback to the days of Watergate, President Donald Trump has reportedly organized a band of so-called plumbers to investigate serious leaks at the White House. Anonymous confidential informants, all members of the White House staff, reported that the president is so disturbed by incessant leaks that he has ordered attorney general Sessions to head the search. Sessions has told other cabinet members that the leaks cannot continue, and that drastic action will be taken to curtail them. He has threatened to subpoena reporters who may have learned of the leaks from the White House staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New York Times, in an editorial today that refused to identify sources, revealed that the current leakage is unrelated to the leak revealed in May. At that time, as reported in a Spoof exclusive, the problem was not technically a leak but was a backup and toilet overflow caused by an an ancient, unpumped White House cesspool. The Times' informants say the present issue is multiple leaks somewhere in an as yet undetermined pipe in the president's bathroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sean Spicer, filling in for the new press secretary as Spicer prepares to leave the White House staff, said that if Sessions is in fact seeking the source of the leak, he would indeed need plumbers but that neither the president nor the attorney general feel that term is acceptable today. Spicer suggested if the plumbers do exist, they be called pipe fitters.\n",

It was most likely rhetorical, but also so ignorant that one moderator accidentally answered it for him. Also, Patton famously led an insane decoy army to distract the Nazis. Saying he's spinning in his grave over someone being bold is like saying, \"I didn't even read the Netflix description of the movie about the guy I'm invoking\" and then adding, \"It is truly impossible to miss how terrible I am.

This lie was almost cute, like when your boyfriend pretends he knew it was your birthday, or when Mike Huckabee's son says, \"The dog was ritually murdered this way when I found it!\" But I don't think Trump was lying! He really thought he had solved ISIS when his very good brain invented the \"sneak attack.\" Paradoxically, he knew it was brilliant, but also so obvious that the generals were stupid for not thinking of it. I know a lot of absurdity is getting thrown around in this article, but he actually said that, and Mike Huckabee's son actually murdered a dog.

In one of his first executive briefings, he asked three times why we can't use nuclear weapons if we have them. That's his understanding of modern warfare -- he thinks all the bad people travel in one bombable group, moving to a new town every time the guileless United States military announces it's coming. Which means their only weakness is the first president with enough balls to instantly and without warning murder their children. It's weird, because most clinical sociopaths know that in order to blend in, they're at least supposed to pretend human life has value.\n",

      "Hillary Clinton’s health scares have been extremely prevalent the past couple days. Even though the Clinton campaign has stated that she has pneumonia, there are people that think otherwise. In fact there is a claim that she might have Parkinson’s disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Republican state representative for New Hampshire made the claim first, on his Facebook account. In fact there was a twitter post by a King Robbo that has evidence to this. “JUST BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED! Her aid asks her to “Squeeze My Fingers” A neurological test! NOT PNEUMONIA! …”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there is more evidence for this. Daniel Tamburello, the co-chair of the Veterans For Trump group, has explained that his father had Parkinson’s and pneumonia is common for people who suffer from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Temburello created a Facebook post detailed what he knows about the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Dad has had Parkinson’s since 1989, so I know a bit about the disease. Hillary has been rumored to have Parkinson’s for some time, as one of the theories to what ails her. (Personally I would surmise it is more than one illness).”\n",
      "\n",
      "While not as educated as a doctor, Tamburello has probably talked to doctors over the past 25 plus years, so he does know what to suspect. Since it was a loved one that has had it, you can be assured that Tamburello is going to pay special attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It has now been admitted she has pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the most common secondary conditions that occurs, and is a high degree secondary issue complicating Parkinson’s patients’ health that causes eventual mortality – again, very common to have Parkinson’s patients die of pneumonia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Since he has been dealing with a family member having Parkinson’s for over 25 years, he has probably heard all of this before. Again even though he is not a doctor, he probably has paid close attention to what has been said to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do a lot of people who have Parkinson’s die of pneumonia? Well Tamburello answers that as well. “The reason is a lack of being able to control the ‘valve’ on your throat that prevents water from going into your lungs when drinking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone has experienced this before. When you drink something and then suddenly start coughing and hacking, it is usually because you tried to take a breath at the same time that you were swallowing. Most people refer to this as “going down the wrong pipe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tamburello continues on in his post. “This in a combination with the recent fondness of mumus, makes me think she is concealing a deep brain stim battery pack that counters her tremors from Parkinson’s (my dad has this battery pack too).”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well that would explain why you never see Clinton shaking, if she does have this. After all that is one of the more noticeable symptoms of Parkinson’s disease is the shaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tamburello finished his post by saying, “They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He offers some evidence, and it could be a reasonable claim. However it appears that his Facebook post was removed. Why would it be removed? Well there are two basic options on why that would happen. The first reason is that it could be true and they don’t want people knowing, and the second reason is that Facebook is actively doing what it can to censor any and all anti-Clinton posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Facebook has a history of trying to censor right wing ideas. After all their trending news team was fired because of that specific reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well there is more evidence for the first case. After Tamburello put his post on Facebook, people on Twitter started looking at the footage of Clinton’s collapse. And they started supporting his claim. Some of the users pointed out that her doctor did the “squeeze my fingers test.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This specific test is a common way to determine neurological health. And furthermore, they use it to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. So all this evidence is going around that supports the claim that Clinton might have Parkinson’s disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now naturally her personal doctor had released a statement that denied these claims. “Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Well of course her doctor is going to say that. But it still doesn’t answer why someone who was helping her was telling her to “squeeze my hand.” And considering that the “squeeze my fingers test” is a common way to diagnose the disease, people are going to become very suspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "People were already wondering about Clinton’s health since she had failed to tell everyone that she had pneumonia in the first place. This is only going to pester her some more until she actually releases her medical records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Share this article to show that the democratic presidential nominee might actually have Parkinson’s disease. With all the evidence that someone who has seen and dealt with the disease for over 25 years, and considering that someone who was there told her to “squeeze my fingers,” which is a common neurological test, it isn’t completely out of the question to say that she has it.\n",

      "The documents have only been partially released on the WikiLeaks website, but The Sensationalist Times received an advance copy of the entire contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to records kept by the White House, Bush left most important decisions up to his staff, aides and other people he hired to do shit around the Oval Office. Condoleezza Rice even made a few decisions herself, although her role during the Bush administration remains, for the most part, an enigma.\n",

      "Janet Ballard of Poughkeepsie, New York, now wishes she hadn’t voted for President Trump. However, she’s still super racist.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Ballard had somewhat opened her mind to others’ viewpoints after the election — viewpoints like “maybe we shouldn’t dump coal into streams” or “I want my children to have health insurance” — at the end of the day, she still really just likes one race, and one race only.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do I wish Trump would stop tweeting out nonsense? Yes. Do I wish he would stop trying to take away my healthcare, sure,” Ballard said. “Do I still mutter ‘Go back to your country’ when my server at Chili’s gets my order wrong, even if they’re a Sicilian-American who was born in Iowa? You betcha. I just thought we’d have that big beautiful wall by now. To keep out the illegals. He’s really let me down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "While Ballard has admitted that, since November 9, Trump seems like “not such a great guy after all” and is “probably worse than my ex-husband,” she still can’t quite put her finger on why she strongly dislikes the only woman of color at her workplace. When asked about her co-worker, Ballard said, “Just something about her I don’t like,” and then told an anecdote that stereotyped the woman based solely on skin color. “I also really thought Hillary would be in prison by now,” she added. “Obama too. Like that woman at work, there’s just something about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ballard’s daughter, Amy, initially welcomed her mom’s newfound anti-Trump views with open arms. “I thought, ‘Cool, she feels bad for voting for him. That’s great!’” Amy said. “But then at the grocery store, the cashier — a lovely man who happens to be from India — told us how much we owed, and my mom scoffed and said, ‘You’re just looking for a handout.’ Then she walked outside and said to an Indian man in a suit, ‘Why is our cashier following me to my car?’ So yeah.

This also makes Barron the head of the investigation into his father’s alleged links to Russia.“I have total faith in Barron’s abilities”, explained President Trump at the new director’s official swearing-in ceremony in Washington D.C. “After all, he’s got great genes. He will lead an independent investigation. He won’t make any allowances for his daddy, who, by the way, can cut his pocket money by a couple hundred thousand bucks any time a certain someone feels the need to poke his nose in some place.”Barron Trump is the third member of President Trump’s family to occupy a high-ranking government post, after the President’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.The 11 year old is to be relatively free to carry out his duties independently. According to inside sources, several of his school friends and a Hulk action figure are already tipped for top jobs in the FBI.The FBI’s cryptography department is now due to be converted to specialise exclusively in developing cheats and hacks for difficult computer games.Meanwhile, Barron Trump seems to be taking his new job very seriously. Even before he had been sworn in, the FBI arrested his former maths teacher Karen Saltzman on his instruction.

      "(NaturalNews) Corruption and \"pay-for-play\" scenarios involving powerful people and foreign governments that beat, imprison and kill gays is like an onion: Peel a layer and you find more.Now, as reported by, it appears as though the \"charity\" was less than charitable with the AIDS drugs it helped distribute to third-world countries battling the disease.Under a program begun by former President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, officials distributed \"watered-down\" HIV/AIDS drugs to sick patients in sub-Saharan Africa, which \"likely increased\" their risk of dying, according to a draft congressional reportobtained.Titled, \"The Clinton Foundation and the India Success Story,\" the congressional report was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is vice chairperson of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to assist AIDS victims has been considered to be a fundamental force for good within the Clinton Foundation and is very probably the organization's most notable initiative.The congressional reported centered on Clinton's 10-plus-year relationship with a controversial India-based drug maker called Ranbaxy. CHAI used the company as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS medications to poor countries.The report also focused on the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a big-time whistleblower when he provided information to the U.S. government, which led to a landmark lawsuit against the Indian pharmaceutical company. Because the company also sold generic drugs in the United States, it was subject to U.S. regulations and prosecution for violations.Ultimately, in 2013 the company pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and to introducing adulterated medications into interstate commerce. \"Adulterated\" is when a drug \"fails to conform to compendial standards of quality, strength or purity,\" according to the Food and Drug Administration In addition, the Department of Justice levied a fine against the company of $500 million, as well as forfeiture.As noted by, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Rod J. Rosenstein, said at the time of Ranbaxy's guilty plea the case represented \"the largest false claims case ever prosecuted\" in his district, as well as the \"nation's largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company.\"\"When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA's approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\" added Stuart F. Delery, the acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Justice Department, after the U.S. government made its announcement regarding Ranbaxy's case.In its final settlement, the Department of Justice stated that, \"allegedly due to the company's diluted drugs, it 'subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,'\" the congressional report noted.In an interview with, Blackburn said the drugmaker's and foundation's actions produce some obvious questions, like, \"How many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise?\"Revelations about CHAI potentially distributing adulterated AIDS drugs to Third World victims is likely to damage the Clinton Foundation's reputation even further, and may add another layer of corruption to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign . Sadly, unless her GOP opponent, Donald J. Trump , brings it up, the mainstream media won't be talking about it any time soon.As for Blackburn, she said she is planning to hand the report over to the inspector general's offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department, where Hillary Clinton served during President Obama's first term.In addition to findings of adulterated drug distribution, the report also shined a light on unseemly ties between Bill Clinton and a pair of highly controversial Indian-Americans who have fallen under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Perhaps what is most problematic for the Clinton charity is its enthusiastic promotion of Ranbaxy, even though the Indian pharmaceutical giant persistently distributes poor-quality drugs, and covers for their faulty products with fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n",

      "WASHINGTON—Saying they wished to pay tribute to the legacies of these distinguished, law-abiding Americans, the Trump administration announced Friday that a long anticipated redesign of the $20 bill would honor Harriet Tubman’s owners. “These were patriotic business proprietors who followed the laws of their time to further their economic interests, and this new currency design finally recognizes these enterprising individuals for their success,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at an afternoon press conference, explaining that the bills commemorating those responsible for enslaving the famed abolitionist, Civil War nurse, and women’s rights activist for the first three decades of her life would be in circulation by 2018. “For too long, we’ve overlooked the achievements of these upstanding citizens and prosperous agriculturalists. The new $20 note, which will feature a portrait of the Brodess family on the front and a depiction of the Maryland plantation they operated on the back, will at last give them their proper place in American history.” Mnuchin then sought to assuage any concerns about the decision, assuring those in attendance that the Trump White House was already looking into ways to preserve Andrew Jackson’s likeness by having it replace Abraham Lincoln on the $5 bill.\n",
      "(SP) – White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee-Sanders announced today that President Trump is set to release an executive order that will ban all Indians from the United States due to the great number of losses being suffered by American League teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is an America first president, and that includes the American League,” said Huckabee-Sanders. “The president has made it clear he wants to ban Indians, from the baseball kind to the dot kind and the feather kind, until we get this figured out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Huckabee-Sanders then added, when pressed by reporters that her dot-and-feather comment was racist, that anyone who accuses the president of racism is merely seeking to divide the country. The president’s spokesperson also refused to comment on reports that Trump ordered the Indian ban after overhearing part of a report on Fox News about the Cleveland Indians winning an American League record 21 games in a row.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the implication is that the president was scrolling through Twitter while taking a bowel movement, and Fox was on in the other room and he just heard a brief snippet about Indians beating Americans and then yelled out to Stephen Miller, while still on the toilet, to ban all Indians from our country,” said Huckabee-Sanders, “well, that’s all the time I have for questions today.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona said his team plans to continue to keep playing as long a they can.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our motivation this whole streak is that the world is basically f–ked, so we may as well play our best until the whole thing goes to hell,” said Francona. “This executive order does nothing to change that point of view.”\n",
      "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Since assuming office on January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump has periodically exchanged messages with intelligent extraterrestrial life forms who, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have provided him with advice and guidance on a multitude of issues ranging from job creation to national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They know he’s an excellent negotiator – probably the best our planet has to offer – and that’s why they’ve elected to speak with him,” Secretary Sanders told a handful of reporters during an off-camera briefing on Wednesday. While Sanders could not comment on the extent or frequency of the encounters, she said President Trump is “extremely humbled” to be the first head of state to make contact with alien life.\n",
      "\n",
      "While senior White House officials and even Trump’s immediate family are reportedly barred from attending meetings between the president and his extraterrestrial advisers, sources close to Mr. Trump say the president has hinted that he’s negotiating a deal with the aliens that will make America “better than anyone ever thought possible.” However, due to the secrecy surrounding President Trump’s private encounters with the extraterrestrials, the terms and precise nature of the deal remain unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "During an interview with Fox News host Shepard Smith, President Trump’s longtime friend and dentist, Dr. Charles H. Brister, DDS, said the president believes he was chosen by the aliens for a reason. “At our last session, [the president] told me how grateful he is to have these beings in his corner, particularly considering how unfairly he’s been treated by the media,” Dr. Brister said, adding, “He’s the only one capable of doing this and he knows it. That’s why the American people elected him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement released Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that, despite the implications, President Donald J. Trump has not yet met face-to-face with the allegedly intelligent beings. As to whether Mr. Trump will have his own close encounter of the third kind is, according to the White House, “between the president and his ET counterparts.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I owe a great debt of gratitude to Pepe, and all who have fought so valiantly under his banner, mercilessly lobbing meme after meme at all of my detractors,” Trump said at the ceremonial presentation of the memorial. “And I cannot forget to specifically mention famous Redditor dank_meme_guy_420, who has created over 300 memes during the war. Just a tremendous, tremendous troll—the very best. A true hero.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The president went on to describe some of his favorite memes to date, including one depicting a Predator drone dropping Pepe the Frog bombs on Hillary Clinton, and another video of President Trump as Rambo annihilating CNN with .50 caliber machine gun fire while Alex Jones body slams NBC in the background.\n",

      "NELSON CO, Va. – Reports are coming in that a Virginia resident combated a sudden house fire by spitting copious amounts of his batch of homemade moonshine onto the burning blaze. Tom Wallace, a Nelson County native, thought he had met his match this past weekend when he suddenly found himself surrounded by an uncontrollable fire. Wallace, however, wasn’t going let his hillside home turn into ashes. “My ol’ hickory moonshine can cure damn near anything,” Wallace commented. “I happened to be mid-swig of some of my Virginia lightning when all of a sudden I done smelt some smoke near the garage. My first thought was ‘Damnit, did I leave the grill on again?’ but before I knew it I was face to face with the devil’s hellfire.” Wallace, who was nowhere near any source of water, resorted to spitting his moonshine onto the fire in an effort to subdue it. “I ain’t about to let no fire take my house away,” slurred Wallace, who managed to walk away from the disaster with only minor burns. However, despite his best efforts, Wallace’s house was eventually fully engulfed by the flames when he hurled the rest of his bottle at the fire in a fit of callous rage.\n",

      "The Russians are employing the exact same tactics that we witnessed in Syria and during the two Chechen wars, but the mainstream media doesn’t seem to understand this. Up to this point, the mainstream media has used the fact that many major Ukrainian cities have not yet fallen as evidence that the war is not going too well for Russia. But the truth is that the Russians did not intend to recklessly send their forces into dense urban areas immediately. That is something that western military leaders do way too often, and it is a way to get thousands of troops needlessly gunned down. Instead, the Russians are encircling the largest Ukrainian cities. A perimeter is established which cuts off all food and supplies, and then the circle is slowly but surely squeezed tighter as the “cauldron” is relentlessly pummeled by Russian firepower.

      "The lawsuit brought about by Bernie Sanders supporters against the Democratic National Committee and its former chairperson Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been dismissed after a court conceded that the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz rigged the primaries—but were well within their rights to do so—seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "After first assuming all the plaintiff’s allegations were true, for the purposes of weighing their claims, Judge William Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on several grounds. The plaintiffs alleged fraud on the part of the DNC in three different ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The DNC did not remain unbiased as evidenced through the DNC emails Wikileaks published.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Donors to the DNC were defrauded because they donated to Bernie Sanders as a Democrat candidate and the fix was in for Hillary Clinton.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. The potential for identity theft was demonstrated when the DNC failed to keep its database of donors and their personal information confidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Michael Sainato writes in the Observer, Zloch, dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation during which DNC attorneys argued that the DNC would be well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidate. “In evaluating Plaintiffs’ claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are true—that the DNC and Wasserman Schultz held a palpable bias in favor Clinton and sought to propel her ahead of her Democratic opponent,” the court order dismissing the lawsuit stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zloch concluded the plaintiffs failed to prove they were materially affected by the alleged bias with which the DNC engaged. He wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Court must now decide whether Plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury particularized to them, or one certainly impending, that is traceable to the DNC and its former chair’s conduct—the keys to entering federal court. The Court holds that they have not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming opinion of those who have actually read WikiLeaks’ leaked DNC email database appears to be that the DNC, Wasserman-Schultz, and the mainstream media all colluded to ensure Clinton would earn the DNC nomination. This was evident on numerous occasions, many of which were caught on live video and openly admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "As The Free Thought Project has extensively reported, influential donors to the DNC are suing their political party for fraud in the 2016 presidential election where they say their candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, was discriminated against. High-ranking members of the DNC, by way of Wikileaks’ DNC email publications, were caught favoring Hillary Clinton over Sanders and actively working to subvert his chances at winning the party’s nomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on technicalities (several of the plaintiffs lived outside of the court’s jurisdiction) and precedents (donors to nonprofits have no legal recourse as to what the organization does with the donations). Zloch never really addressed the claims of the plaintiffs, only whether or not they had a legal claim for damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zloch admonished the plaintiffs his court was not the place to air their grievances. Instead, they should have done so at the ballot box, inside the DNC, and to work inside the system—a system they clearly believe to be rife with corruption. Zloch wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This Order, therefore, concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction. To the extent Plaintiffs wish to air their general grievances with the DNC or its candidate selection process, their redress is through the ballot box, the DNC’s internal workings, or their right of free speech—not through the judiciary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Zloch dismissed the case against the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz by declaring, “the Court finds that the named Plaintiffs have not presented a case that is cognizable in federal court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the case, Jared Beck, went off! Here’s what he had to say in response to the dismissal and it’s epic! His rant starts at the 9-minute mark.\n",

      "His reaction describes the deaths of process server Shawn Lucas, DNC data manager Seth Rich, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Beranton Whisenant alludes to the Deep State, and points the finger of blame at the Military Industrial Complex.\n",

Ya know, it goes beyond a lack of awareness in this country. This country has a vicious, corrupt core… and the MOST vicious, corrupt people are sitting in D.C. right now, running the show and forming the media elite and establishment that surrounds and protects them, and promulgates their bullshit all over the airwaves. And I am sick and f***ing tired of living in this country and having those be the people that run the show. We see our clients lose in court, all the time. We see them get shafted by the healthcare system, get shafted by this country, and nobody in this country gives a f*** about them, who’s in the leadership… Let me tell you something: I know that those problems… the problem in this country, in terms of corruption… I know that it’s so deep-seated… It’s taken root over many, many decades, and it’s not going anywhere any time soon. But my HOPE—my hope in filing this lawsuit was that at least it might be some kind of spark to get things rolling, so that by the time my kids are adults in this society, they’re not living under an immoral, oligarchic, tyrannical piece-of-shit government that f***ing goes to war in MY name, with my tax dollars, on a perpetual basis and f***ing incinerating people, and I have NO f***ing channel to STOP it. And as an American, I am ashamed. I am ashamed to call myself an American. And let me tell you something else: There were people in Nazi Germany who didn’t know what the f*** was going on, either… They were f***ing clueless. They were f***ing brainwashed. And I’m not making this comparison because of any bullshit comparison between Trump and Nazism that’s going around that the mainstream media wants you to believe. What I’m talking about is the REAL government we have in this country. And in my view, they are morally equivalent, or worse, than the government of Nazi Germany… Because they’ve been going on longer, and they’ve been f***ing over not just everybody in THIS country, but around the world. And I’m f***ing sick of it, as a human being.”\n",

They were buried in some of America’s finest coffins, by the way — wood that was actually luxurious for a dead body, not those cheap egg carton coffins China’s making today — and now, what, we’re digging them up and wasting all that wood? I could probably build one of the finest properties in the world with that wood — maybe a little steel, too; I’d need maybe a little, maybe a little — but no, no, these people? No values.

Representative Barbara Comstock (R-VA) has proposed a bill that would protect Muslims from Islamophobic comments and she is not alone as many in the House are hoping the bill gets through.\n",

      "The bill also calls for new task forces to be created that would seek out and prosecute individuals who violate the proposed law. This means that our representatives want to create secret police forces appointed by bureaucrats to carry out laws that prohibit the criticism of Islam. If one begins to think of religious police who come to silence or kill journalists, activists, or anyone who disagrees with Islam’s culture of domination then one would have the proper idea of the kinds of forces that are going to be appointed.\n",

      "Question -- What is the goal of this website? Why do we share different sources of information that sometimes conflicts or might even be considered disinformation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer -- The primary goal of Nesaranews is to help all people become better truth-seekers in a real-time boots-on-the-ground fashion. This is for the purpose of learning to think critically, discovering the truth from within—not just believing things blindly because it came from an \"authority\" or credible source. Instead of telling you what the truth is, we share information from many sources so that you can discern it for yourself. We focus on teaching you the tools to become your own authority on the truth, gaining self-mastery, sovereignty, and freedom in the process. We want each of you to become your own leaders and masters of personal discernment, and as such, all information should be vetted, analyzed and discerned at a personal level. We also encourage you to discuss your thoughts in the comments section of this site to engage in a group discernment process.\n",

      "Paris (dpo) - Scandal takes hold of Donald Trump’s trip to France. On a visit to the capital, the President of the United States became enraged that the French had shamelessly copied the tower of the famous Paris Las Vegas Hotel in Nevada, USA. President Trump explained that he is fighting back against other nations simply appropriating symbols of American culture in this way.The President was already taken aback when he learned that the French capital was also called Paris, just like the famous hotel in Las Vegas. “At that stage, it could still have been a coincidence,” opined Trump. “It’s a pretty popular name. Paris Hilton’s called Paris, too.”However, when he observed the distinctive shape of the tower, the brazen conterfeit could not be mistaken:“I know a cheap copy when I see one!” the US President is reported to have told French President, Emmanuel Macron, in his fury. “That is practically an exact copy of the Paris Las Vegas tower! And I know a thing or two about hotels and casinos.”An angered Trump was not about to accept any objections from his host, Emmanuel Macron, either. “He had the audacity to claim that it was completely the other way around! As if the greatest country in the world would need to copy from anyone else!”In fact, half the world is in the business of copying American landmarks. “I hear there are several buildings in Egypt that are just poor-quality copies of the famous Luxor Casino in Las Vegas and in China there are even several whole cities that look just like Chinatown in New York.”President Trump explained that he would work to ensure that these impudent counterfeiters either demolish their replicas or pay royalties to the USA. Otherwise, he fears the French may also one day build a copy of the Statue of Liberty.Read the German version HERE\n",

Workers were hired, sketches were done and we were ready to launch the project. It’s a sad day around here.”\n",
      "\n",

But the truth is that the Russians did not intend to recklessly send their forces into dense urban areas immediately. That is something that western military leaders do way too often, and it is a way to get thousands of troops needlessly gunned down. Instead, the Russians are encircling the largest Ukrainian cities. A perimeter is established which cuts off all food and supplies, and then the circle is slowly but surely squeezed tighter as the “cauldron” is relentlessly pummeled by Russian firepower.

      "\n",
      "During Wednesday’s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a strange response when European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker criticized President Donald Trump’s comprehension of world affairs. Last week, Junker warned that more countries may leave the European Union after Trump’s administration applauded Britain’s departure from the EU. “I think the president is very well steeped in world affairs, especially Europe, NATO, all of the issues,” Spicer insisted. “He was a leader in the effort to call BREXIT, as you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked to comment on whether there was any connection between President Trump’s position on BREXIT and the fact that the majority of Britain’s citizens voted for leaving the EU, Spicer argued that the British were “smitten” with the billionaire businessman-turned-president’s language skills, and decided to hear him out. “As we all know, President Trump and citizens of the UK haven’t really gotten off on the right foot, so to speak. I think we all remember that, at one point, there was even a petition floating around to ban Donald Trump from entering Great Britain,” Spicer reminded members of the press.\n",
      "\n",
      "“However, if you were to ask the British today how they felt about our president, I believe you would encounter very different responses,” he continued. “In my personal opinion, it is my belief that the British people became so smitten with the fact that Donald Trump at one point spoke upper-class, eloquent English that they realized he was an okay person. To make matters even more obvious, President Trump is, after all, of Scottish heritage on his mother’s side. So, there’s also that. Now, I’m well aware of the fact that the English and the Scottish don’t always see eye to eye despite being in the same union, but it would seem they have managed to find common ground when it comes to President Donald Trump.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked to elaborate further on Trump’s rumored “eloquent” language skills, the press secretary argued that, even though Trump’s language was a much-disputed point during his campaign, “Donald Trump is known as an extremely hard worker and self-made billionaire.” He also said, “That’s why it comes as no surprise that he was able to improve his language to the point where he became a favorite of the citizens of the country in which our language first originated. And to put that in perspective, we’re talking here about England, which as you all know, has pretty much nothing left to show for other than it’s complicated language rules and extremely broad dictionary.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the end of the day, I’m not going to say that the English voted to leave the EU because Donald Trump said it would be a good idea. However, I would like to believe that deep down, they listened to him and really heard what he was saying precisely because he was speaking very nice in their language. When you compare that to the situation in which they’re debating whether or not they’re going to let him into the country, I think that’s equivalent to climbing Mount Everest in a matter of minutes. It was a huge undertaking. And by the way, the fact that Mount Everest’s summit is just as cold as the British are towards Americans makes it all the more sweeter for him, I would imagine,” Spicer concluded.\n",

      "Washington, D.C. – An announcement was made on Wednesday by the Trump Administration which states a new law that will take effect April 10, 2020 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.\n",

      "\n",
      "Acting as insane as ever too, this report continues, the true intentions of the United States towards Syria are not yet able to be deciphered by any normal mind either—as nearly immediately after the American’s “begged for mercy” for their Islamic terrorist forces facing annihilation in Syria, and agreed to keep them from entering Deir ez-Zor, both OCCRP and BIRN shockingly discovered that the Trump administration was budgeting another $600 million in illegal arms sales to these Islamic terrorists in order to keep this war ongoing—and with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, also, continuing the “critically flawed” US policy that states “America will not be satisfied as long as Syrian President Bashar Assad is in power”.\n",

      "\n",
      "It also suggests that Former F.B.I. Director James Comey deliberately perjured himself when he appeared before a House subcommittee and denied any knowledge that Donald Trump – first as a candidate and then as the president – had been wiretapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "When President Trump tweeted that he had been wiretapped while in Trump Tower the media tried painting him as a conspiracy nut.\n",
      "\n",
      "CNN pounced on Trump for starting a conspiracy theory and that the wiretapping claim was an “incendiary idea.” CNN was only the tip of the spear. MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The L.A. Times, the entirety of the Deep State controlled mainstream media all joined in discrediting the newly elected president.\n",

      "A full 42 days before Trump’s tweet, the NY Times was the first to report that he had been wiretapped. That was before it was decided that it would be best to deny it ever happened because they found nothing incriminating.\n",

      "The fact that the wiretaps turned up nada meant that Obama had convinced the FISA court to give the NSA and the FBI a fishing license for political purposes. That is the way the Soviet Union operated against their political enemies.\n",

      "In the United States our government is prevented from opening investigations without just cause. At least we thought so. Foolish us. After the IRS scandal why would we trust the Obama administration to play it straight on anything else? Shame on us.\n",

      "Essentially the mainstream media chose to twist the emerging facts into knots once it became obvious that James Comey was lying to protect his illegal use of FISA court warrants under orders from President Obama.\n",
      "\n",

      "Today our investigative work was vindicated. The mainstream media, led by CNN, was forced to admit that the U.S. government, under President Barack Obama, had wiretapped Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, including his conversations with President Trump — both during after the 2016 presidential campaign.\n",

      "(SP) – Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone named Blake Bortles the team’s starting quarterback today, putting a talented roster into the hands of a quarterback who has been one of the league’s worst over the past three seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But instead of looking outside the team for a better quarterback, the Jaguars instead today doubled down on Bortles — and Marrone believes it will be enough to see Jacksonville win the AFC South and make the playoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There are many who say that Bortles isn’t a good quarterback and that he can’t throw football near his receivers and that he’s a proven loser,” said Marrone. “And not just many say that. All say it. Because it’s true. But one thing he does do is stand for the pregame national anthem — same as every quarterback who has won the Super Bowl. Sorry, but I think that’s some pretty good company to be in. I’ll take my chances.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jaguars receiver Allen Robinson said he is happy that Jacksonville is sticking with Bortles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do I think we’ll make the playoffs with him? No, not at all,” said Robinson. “But knowing that he is somewhere on the sidelines standing up and not kneeling, will make the next three hours of losing 30-10 feel so much better.”\n",

      "CHAPPAQUA, NY—Saying it would provide a candid account of her experiences writing an unsuccessful tell-all, sources confirmed Thursday that Hillary Clinton is already working on a follow-up book casting blame for the failures of her previous memoir What Happened. “From my agent negotiating that underwhelming deal with Simon & Schuster, to the graphic designer’s lackluster cover art, to my so-called supporters who couldn’t be bothered to drop $17.99 for the hardcover copy—everyone had a hand in undermining my last book’s success,” reads a passage from the introduction to Clinton’s What Also Happened, which repeatedly decries her prior book’s “indecipherable” font and dedicates an entire chapter to lashing out at her copy editor for making her look like “an idiot third-grader.” “I’ll never forget how Amazon buried me and how Barnes & Noble completely sabotaged me by displaying my book way in the back in that no man’s land by the CDs. Frankly, it’s obvious I got screwed on all sides.” Accusing them of stealing her spotlight, the book reportedly concludes with a long list of every other celebrity who published a memoir in the past year.\n"
