0,"Writer, Louri Michaelevitch, a former personnal assistant of the Russian President, was found dead last monday in his swiss appartment after some of the neighbors complained about the smell emanating from the residence.

According to the city’s police departmnent, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot.

“The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team” explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department.”We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.”

The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “Я был любовник Путина” (“I was Putin’s Lover“), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand of political asylum from the helvetic state.

Many sources also claim that Mr Michaelevitch had dinner with an attaché of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.",Fake
1,"Johnston Wilson McGill, 34, was pronounced dead on his couch by a private doctor after suffering an apparent heart attack. It has happened just days after being summoned to appear before Trey Gowdy’s congressional committee to testify about Hillary Clinton’s email server. McGill was one of Clinton's aides. The death was reported hapanned at her home of “natural causes.”

A spokesman for Clinton’s former campaign said that Huma Abedin, Clinton’s deputy campaign coordinator, found McGill when she stopped by for coffee to discuss Clinton’s plans for a run for Mayor of New York.

Trey Gowdy’s office had no official statement but his top aide, Mandy Gonsales, said that the committee isn’t happy with the circumstances of McGill’s death or the fact that his own doctor was summoned to pronounce. Abedin says she called the private doctor because she hoped he could save her friend.

There will be no autopsy on the body, which will be cremated before sunset in accordance with his religion. McGill is the single son of deceased parents and has no family. No services are planned.

Does this whole thing seem a little bit odd to anyone else? It feels oddly like we’ve seen things like this happen before to people who could possibly incriminate Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, as the doctor who pronounced has an impeccable record and is an authorized coroner in new York, the findings will be accepted and entered into public record.",Fake

3,"Roger Stone Blames Obama For The Possibility Of Trump Having Alzheimer’s Because “His Attacks On The President Caused Severe Stress”

The whispers are growing louder that President Donald Trump may be suffering some sort of mental decline and cognitive impairment – and his longtime pal Roger Stone thinks it’s a conspiracy. MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, who has known the president for years, has been suggesting on air that Trump is suffering from mental decline and possibly even dementia. Stone, who has known the president for decades and claims to remain in close contact, told InfoWars founder Alex Jones the concerns about Trump’s mental state were part of a plot to remove him from the White House, reported Mediaite. “They are going to claim that Donald Trump has Alzheimer’s…and that is the source of his insanity,” Stone told Jones.

“Look, Alex – I’ve known Donald Trump for many years now and during that time I’ve gotten very close with him,” Stone said. “Just like you’re able to tell when your mother or father or some other family member or friend you spend a lot of time with starts to change in any way, I’m also able to tell you all of Donald’s little habits, mannerisms, quirky gestures he makes when he speaks and even predict what he’s going to say and how he’s going to behave depending on his mood. As a matter of fact, I’d even go so far as to say that the man is more like a brother to me than a friend. And like I said, when you’ve spent that much time with someone and gotten to know virtually everything about them, it’s very easy to tell if and when they start behaving oddly. You know what I mean?”

Stone continued, “I’m telling you right here and now – it’s all one huge conspiracy to get people to believe Donald is unfit for duty and get him out of the White House. It’s the only option they have left, since they couldn’t beat him the normal way. Donald Trump does not have Alzheimer’s, dementia or whatever else they’re saying he’s suffering from.” Jones asked, “But look, I hear you, I get what you’re saying and I’m on your side, but you have to admit – he’s not a young man anymore, he’s 70 years old and he’s continuously been exposed to huge amounts of stress on a daily level for decades. Are you saying that’s not even a remote possibility?” Stone replied, “Well, that’s the thing, Alex – I’m not a doctor. I’ve spoken to him recently and he was his usual self, from what I could gather.”

“That being said, in my book, he’s the same, old Donald whom I’ve known for years and years. Of course, as I mentioned – I’m not a doctor or a professional, so I don’t have any medical argumentation to support my claims. But, I will say this: in the unlikely event I’m wrong and he does have a mental impairment, it’s Barack Obama’s fault. I mean, Barack Obama has attacked Donald Trump since the moment he realized that Donald was thinking about running for president – I think even before he initiated his campaign. His attacks on Donald Trump caused immense stress on a daily level because, that’s the thing – Obama had no other arguments to dispute Donald’s campaign other than to make jokes about how he’s a bad employer and how business is all he’s ever been good at. Sure, he’s not a politician, but he’s a self-made man. In my book, that’s way better than being a so-called Democrat who cares more about illegal and Muslim immigrants than he does for his own people. So, I would certainly understand if Donald has Alzheimer’s because of Barack Obama,” Stone concluded.",Fake
4,"Bill O’Reilly: “Companies Under Trump Must Say ‘Merry Christmas’ Or Will Be Forced To “Send Employees To Religious Classes”

Of all the voices crusading against the so-called “War on Christmas,” perhaps no TV personality has lent their star power to the fight against encroaching secular influence that Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has. On Thursday, the O’Reilly Factor host called out the “companies that kind of marginalized Christmas” this year by failing to use the word in their holiday advertisements and promotions, including Best Buy, Barnes & Noble and Victoria’s Secret. “Those companies are not in the Christmas spirit,” O’Reilly complained. “And that’s bad news for them, because Donald Trump is on the case.”

The pundit argued that the companies in question will be “forced to send employees to religious classes” if they continue to avoid greeting their customers with the words “Merry Christmas.” “They’ve got a lot of nerve,” he said. “The vast majority of the people that frequent their stores are Christians, traditional Americans and people who respect and honor these sort of traditions. And when you, as a company that’s making money directly off of your customers, refuse to adopt the same values and traditions as your market, you’re done. I know it sounds cruel, but that’s just the name of the game.”

“And while we’re on the subject,” O’Reilly continued, “that’s also one of the things I have a problem with in American society as of late. We’re a nation of immigrants, bla bla bla, everybody already knows the whole story. However, the whole point of America is, we’re supposed to be always accepting new immigrants, which we’re doing, by the boatloads, but at the same time, we’re also supposed to be assimilating them into American society. After a period of time, they’re supposed to become Americans, not stay whatever they were before they came here. And that also goes for religion, as well.”

The host also added, “And before someone calls me up and accuses me of being bigoted, let me just say that I don’t think all naturalized Americans should be Christians. Everybody here is completely entitled to their own religious freedom. However, that doesn’t change the fact that the majority of the people born in this country are, in fact, Christians. And given that it’s our country, not that of our immigrant new citizens – we ought to be greeted with ‘Merry Christmas’ when we walk into the aforementioned stores to spend our hard earned money. And when our immigrant citizens greet us there as part of their jobs, they should remember that they came to work to America, not the other way around.”

“And if the aforementioned companies don’t start instructing their employees to use ‘Merry Christmas’ as an official greeting soon, they are going to be forced to send their employees off to religious training lessons and classes, where they will be trained in everything Christianity stands for. And that’s going to be the hard way to solve this problem, since the easy way is not likely to work – I can see that even now. So, either companies teach their off-the-books immigrant workers to pronounce the words ‘Merry Christmas’ when they see a white American person walking into their store, or Uncle Sam is going to do it for them. And trust me, guys – you’re not going to like what Uncle Sam has planned. I can’t tell you all the details, but I’m fairly certain it’ll include the words ‘water’ and ‘boarding’ at some point,” O’Reilly concluded.",Fake

7,"Democrats argue that the GOP fixation on voter fraud is all about denying some citizens the right to vote, meanwhile Republicans argue that the Democrats near-monolithic defense of voter fraud is all about winning extra votes. Both arguments have merit, but the Democrats are lying when they pretend that the problem simply doesn’t exist.

Every election there are countless examples of voter fraud (sometimes even mass voter fraud) that come to light, and this election has been no different. However, the latest shoe to drop on the voter fraud front could be a game changer… if the national media will pay any attention to the story.

In New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton won the vote by the slimmest of margins. Less than 3K votes separated the two candidates. The race for Senator was even closer, and some local elections were decided by just a handful of votes. These facts make what the state government just discovered all the more troubling.

State law requires that anyone moving to the state must acquire a new driver’s license within 60 days of establishing residency, but more than 5K 2016 voters have still not done that, leading authorities to believe that these were fraudulent voters who came to the state to influence the outcome of the election.

On Nov. 8, 2016, 6,540 voters used an out-of-state driver’s license as identification to vote but as of Aug. 30, 2017, only 1,014 of those individuals – 15.5 percent – had been issued a New Hampshire driver’s license, according to the data.

Of the remaining 5,526 individuals, only 3.3 percent – about 213 people – had a registered motor vehicle.

That would leave 5,313 people who used an out-of-state license to vote but never obtained a new New Hampshire license despite being required to by state law after implying that they were establishing residency or domicile in the state to vote in November.

Of the 5,313 individuals who registered to vote same-day on Election Day, 81 percent – 4,314 people – neither held a New Hampshire driver’s license nor had a registered vehicle in the state ever.

With the exception of the gubernatorial race – where Republican Chris Sununu easily bested Democrat Colin Van Ostern by more than 16,000 votes – Democrats won all the other statewide and Congressional races.

But three races were determined by less than 5,000 votes: Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, beat incumbent U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte by 1,017 votes – although many have suspected that last minute, illegal campaign mailers pushing votes to independent Aaron Day cost Ayotte the race. Hillary Clinton bested Donald Trump by 2,736, earning the state’s 4 Electoral College votes even though she ultimately lost the presidency. U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter was sent back to Congress after she bested incumbent U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta by a few more than 4,900 votes.

In the grand scheme of things 5K fraudulent votes in a nation of 315 million people may not seem like much, but in a state where 3 of the most important races were decided by less than 5K votes, it’s monumental. Consider the failed Obamacare repeal vote; could Senator Kelly Ayotte have helped the GOP ram repeal through? Or how much help could Rep. Frank Guinta be giving the House GOP if he’d actually defeated his liberal opponent?

The state government must continue its investigation and these fraudulent voters must be brought to justice. Voter fraud is a felony and it should be investigated and prosecuted as such.",Fake
8,"In an audio recording provided to Big League Politics by a source that currently wishes to remain anonymous, journalist Seymour Hersh confirms that Seth Rich had contacted WikiLeaks with sample emails from the leak. Hersh cites an FBI document as proof for his claim.

“There are no DNC or Podesta emails that exist beyond May 21 or 22, last email from either one of those groups. What the report says is that some time in late Spring… he makes contact with WikiLeaks, that’s in his computer,” he says. “Anyway, they found what he had done is that he had submitted a series of documents — of emails, of juicy emails, from the DNC.”

Hersh explains that it was unclear how the negotiations went, but that WikiLeaks did obtain access to a password protected DropBox where Rich had put the files.

“All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I’m sure dozens of emails, and said ‘I want money.’ Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,” he said. They got access to the DropBox.”

Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him, and had

“The word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that ‘if anything happens to me it’s not going to solve your problems,’” he added. “WikiLeaks got access before he was killed.”

This conversation is the second in a series provided to Big League Politics.

Seymour Hersh did not contact the family with his information.

In the first audio recording, private investigator Rod Wheeler explains what happened with the Fox News coverage of Seth Rich — and how brother Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection. His story in the audio contradicts reports of White House involvement with the media reports regarding Seth Rich.

Wheeler also said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth’s computer, even though there could be evidence on it. “He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,” Wheeler said. “I said, well can I look at it?…He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don’t worry about it.”",Fake
9,"INI World Report > Uncategorized > THE UNANSWERED MYSTERY OF THE CENTURY!!!

A GREAT SIGNIFICANT SERIOUS MYSTERY ~ A MUST READ !!!

(and the answer to the final question below is: “No! just dumbed-down!!!”)

When Obama is out of office it will be interesting to see what they put in his “Library” regarding his early years. In a country where we take notice of many facets of our public figures’ lives, doesn’t it seem odd that there’s so little we know about our current man in the White House, Barack Obama?

For example, we know that Andrew Jackson’s wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery. Abe Lincoln never went to school. Jack Kennedy wore a back brace. Harry Truman played the piano.

As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single amazing fact about the history of our two term president — Barack Hussein Obama.

We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama, because the management of that document has been spectacularly successful.

There are however, several additional oddities in Obama’s history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue.

Another interesting thing: There are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found?

It’s interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up. The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all know about JFK’s magnetism; that McCain was no monk; quite a few details about Palin’s courtship and even her athletic prowess; Joe Biden’s aneurisms are no secret; look at Cheney and Clinton — we all know about their heart problems. Certainly Wild Bill Clinton’s exploits before and during his White House years, were well known. That’s why it’s so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, “He was soooo shy…” or “What a great dancer…”

It’s virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow. Who was the best man at his wedding? Start there. Then check groomsmen.

Then get the footage of his graduation ceremony. Has anyone talked to the professors? It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him.

When did he meet Michele, and how? Are there photos there? Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc. for their library, etc. What has he released? And who voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010? Doesn’t this make you wonder?

Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obama’s past saying they knew him, attended school with him, or was his friend ? Not one person has ever come forward from his past, and that certainly is very, very strange.

This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced shadow man. Have you seen a movie named “The Manchurian Candidate” ? It is a classic, and it is pertinent.

As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face. Someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully or something about us.

George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia — the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him.

If he is such a great orator; why doesn’t anyone in Obama’s college class remember him? Why won’t he allow Columbia to release his records? The fact is that Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University.

Looking for evidence of Obama’s past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there… but none remembered him.

Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama, “I don’t know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don’t have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia, ever.”

Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of ’83 Political Science, and says, “You don’t get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don’t know anyone who ever met him. At class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who’s kind of the, as we say in New York, ‘the macha’ who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him.”

And Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia, or to provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia.

Some other interesting questions: Why was Obama’s law license inactivated in 2002? It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam. and Why was Michelle’s law license inactivated by court order? We understand that was forced or required to avoid fraud charges.

It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama, but there are

27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias connected to him.

The Social Security number Obama now uses originated in Connecticut, where Obama is reported to have never lived. The number was originally registered to another man (Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut, who died in Hawaii while on vacation there. As we all know, Social Security Numbers are only issued once, and they are not reused. No wonder all his records are sealed !!!

Please continue sending this out. Somewhere, Someone has to know SOMETHING!?! School? Before he became an “organizer” in Chicago? SOMETHING!!! He just seemed to burst upon the Scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention. ANYONE??? ANYWHERE??? ANYTHING???

Surely in the near future, when he no longer has the power of the presidency, much will come to light about this highly unqualified person who has been president of the United States for 8 years. Soon, we will know how badly we were all doped and duped by this imposter who has, with much help from “those who created him,” nearly brought the greatest nation in history to its knees in ruins. And that will be his legacy — the man who destroyed the Integrity, Morals and Christian Heritage of our once great country.

Who in the hell is this man? Is America stupid or what?",Fake

THIS IS CONFIRMED ACCURATE, AND IS RIPPED STRAIGHT OFF THE WORLDNOW MEDIA SERVER FOX, CBS, AND OTHERS USE. THIS IS NOT A SPOOF, THEY ALREADY FINALIZED THE ELECTION.

Worldnow is a central company that helps all the news stations stay synchronized so they all report the same news. This is a bust of that company, that already has the election results ready for the stations to post, complete with their station graphics. On election day, they go live with this. This is completely confirmed in the second report on this page, covering this topic.

Get the WRCBtv (Chattanooga) page that has already been prepared for election night directly from worldnow while it lasts and here is the direct link to WRCBtv that proves they don’t have it posted yet. IMPORTANT – look at the lower left hand corner of your browser when you access WRCBtv. You will see all content is coming from Worldnow.com, which proves that the page capture in the picture below is a hidden page that will be used. You can’t get to it from ANYWHERE on the WRCBtv web site, it is waiting to be posted.

HERE IS THE STOLEN ELECTION, IN DETAIL. This was pre-prepared for a tv station in Memphis. You can see that this is set up to hit the end percentages with an algorithm to steal it changing the numbers as the vote progresses to hit those percentages by cross checking this first list here, which has already been prepared for WMCTV in Memphis, with the second list that is embedded in the report below this, that was prepared for a news aggregating web site that happened to use Worldnow, where I prove this is legit. Comparing the two lists mathematically proves yet another way that an algorithm with dynamic fractional vote tabulation that is tasked to hit end result percentages is being used to steal the election.

Here are the easy to read totals THAT ARE ALREADY TABULATED FOR WMCTV in Memphis. There is not just one news station showing this. It is a complete bust of the entire system.

13,"Washington, DC — During an interview today with Fox News, Donald Trump unveiled plans making it mandatory for all Muslim people and refugees entering this country, along with those currently residing in the U.S., to wear badges on their outer garments at all times. The 2016 presidential candidate says these badges are necessary so refugees and Muslims can easily be identified and monitored.

“They are a danger to our Christian way of life in America, it’s that simple,” Trump said. ‘The Muslims, they want us dead, we know that for a fact. The refugees are joining ISIS and are pouring into our country like that. They both hate our freedom and way of life, you can’t argue that. By enforcing and requiring these possible terrorists to wear badges at all time they can be easily identified and tracked if necessary. This is nothing like the badges the Jews had to wear during the Holocaust, that was different, but you know, it’s the same thing. These are tough times right now and I’m just saying what everyone else is too afraid to say. We can take back America, we just need to work together, it’s never too late.”

Trump went further by saying he would put all the Muslims and refugees entering this country on their own land, with critics comparing that to Hitler’s concentration camps during World War II.

“There is no reason we shouldn’t put them all on their own land like how we did with the Indians. We know what these people are capable of and I know I’m scared, and I know most Americans are too. We need to act now before more innocent lives are lost.”

Last week Trump told various news sources he would implement databases to track every Syrian refugee, Muslim and mosque in this country.

“We’re going to have to do things that we never did before,” Trump said in an interview with Yahoo News. “Some people are going to be upset about it, but I think that now everybody is feeling that security is going to rule.”

Appearing Sunday on ABC’s “This Week”, Trump was asked about the databases.

“I want a database for the refugees,” Trump said. “We have no idea who these people are. When the Syrian refugees are going to start pouring into this country, we don’t know if they’re ISIS, we don’t know if it’s a Trojan horse. And I definitely want a database and other checks and balances.”

President Obama has expanded the usual annual ceiling for refugees of 70,000 by an additional 15,000, with 10,000 of those new slots for Syrians. At the outset, officials said this program for Syrian refugees probably would continue beyond one year. But nothing approaching 250,000, which Trump routinely says, is in the works.

Historians of the Third Reich and Nazi Holocaust say that these methods of government control paved the way for the acceptance of the Holocaust by German citizens.

“The German government’s policy of forcing Jews to wear identifying badges was but one of many psychological tactics aimed at isolating and dehumanizing the Jews of Europe, directly marking them as being different and inferior to everyone else,” Paul Horner of the Holocaust Center said. “It allowed for the easier facilitation of their separation from society and subsequent ghettoization, which ultimately led to the deportation and murder of 6 million Jews. What Donald Trump is doing is just the beginning, exactly how Hitler started out. More hate and ignorance is definitely what we don’t need in this country right now.” Horner continued, “The only thing good coming from all of this, is that Trump is keeping comedy writers employed and making cash. This stupid moron is a wet dream for writers of comedy all around the world; it’s not even fair. He writes the story himself, you just have to report what he did and said and your job is done. I truly hope he gets the Republican nomination, we need to keep this cash cow alive. He’ll lose to ANYONE that gets elected on the Democratic side, but until then, we must remember these good times and how backwards him and all of his followers are.”

The yellow badges that were given to the Jews by the Nazis, was a cloth patch sewn on their outer garments that marked them as Jews in public. Intended or not, it served as a badge of shame, making them easily identifiable.",Fake
14,"In a move the Trump administration calls “just another example of American carnage,” the National Parks Service admitted today in a press conference they had plans to add the face of former President Barack Obama to the Mount Rushmore National Monument.

Henry Murphy, a spokesman from the NPS, told reporters that the organization’s leaders had been planning to add Obama’s face for a while now.

The new construction would’ve have been classified as a “progressive renovation” of the chunk of rock next to the bust of Abraham Lincoln.

The plan was foiled when, this past week, a Trump aide was accidentally CC’ed on a NPS email about the project.

“We were hoping to have the project completed by the summer of 2018, just in time for President Trump’s impeachment,” Murphy said during the press conference. “We had everything set. Workers were hired, sketches were done and we were ready to launch the project. It’s a sad day around here.”

When asked how the NPS would pay for the project, Murphy danced around an answer. In a follow-up question, Murphy admitted that the parks service backdoored money from contributions to the Environmental Protection Agency’s global-warming research fund.

From there, he said, the NPS channeled the money to an unnamed investor who, according to sources, is the same investor who paid for protesters to block the construction of the Dakota Pipeline project.

That investor provided some 300 workers for the Mount Rushmore project; all off the books, according to the NPS. A source close to one of the project’s organizers said all but five of the workers double as pipeline protesters.

“Call it what you want, but we felt like this was the right thing to do,” Murphy said. “Barack’s face was slim enough, our artists told us, to squeeze it in right next to Lincoln.”

The NPS said they were prepared to launch a series of tweets about the matter, but decided not to post them for fear of reprisal from Trump’s administration

Hector Guthrie, one of the artists involved in the project, said he was proud of the work but that there was a lot of battling back and forth about what should and shouldn’t be added to the sculpture.

“A few people in the group were worried about the birther arguments that inevitably would come up once the project was done,” Guthrie said. “So, we decided to etch Obama’s birth certificate across his forehead in both English and Arabic. The letters would be really small, though, so you wouldn’t be able to see them unless you were up close.”",Fake

16,"Washington, DC — A former Secret Service agent whose new book is quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts, said he is concerned about the state of the country and says it is time the public knows the real truth about our Commander in Chief, Barack Obama.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off.

In an interview with NBC News, Horner told Senior Political Analyst Tom Downey that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well.

“Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”

Downey: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?”

Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.”

Downey: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?”

Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross at full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep. This is one of the main reasons I finally had to quit.”

Downey: “Can you give us any insight on Obama’s feelings towards the American people?”

Horner: “He constantly made jokes about Americans, frequently referring to them as “mongoloids” and “idiots”. Christians were his favorite verbal punching bags. He has absolutely no respect for the Christian religion. I believe he actually hates Christians, and finds their ideology to be old fashioned and ignorant.”

Downey: “What are some of the things the public will find the most shocking?”

Horner: “Probably the sheer amount of men he welcomed into his bed quarters. I am in no way homophobic, but Obama’s insatiable lust for homosexual liaisons is like nothing I’ve ever witnessed. We’re talking 10-15 partners in a single day.”

Downey: “That’s amazing, 10-15 in a single day? Wow.”

Horner: “Also, at least once a day, Obama would have us log on to Facebook and report a page about a Dolphin named Fappy who travels around the country speaking to elementary school children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. It was all very, very strange stuff.”

Downey: “Is there anything else you can tell us?”

Horner: “Yeah (Horner smiles), buy the book.”

19,"A radical Muslim who attempted to kill a Christian pastor earlier this month was arrested for an attack on President Donald Trump.

According to the United States Secret Service, Ibn Yakoobi was a “Muslim extremist” who was part of a mob that recently attacked Christians and destroyed their church in Mobile, Alabama in July.

The attack took place today outside of Trump Towers in New York as the President was exiting the building into his presidential motorcade. After being greeted by reporters, one man stepped forward introducing himself as a commentator from the conservative new station FOX News.

Yakoobi asked the President about future restrictions on Muslims into the U.S. and at that moment, the man grabbed a tire iron from the sidewalk and hit Trump in the head, knocking him unconscious.

The terrorist was immediately restrained by Secret Service and Trump was taken to the hospital for examination. President Trump is recovering well, but being monitored for a concussion.

Yakoobi is being held and questioned. No terror organization has claimed responsibility for this attack as of yet. The White House Administration is calling this a “Lone Wolf” attack.",Fake

21,"There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) device that is said to be “upcoming technology” that we will see in our near future.

But not as controversial as the report that has come out of Washington DC today.

Hospital workers have come forward with new information that proves to be the largest breach of privacy United States citizens have ever uncovered.

According to several “hospital insiders” employees have been forced to microchip newborn babies in thousands of hospitals across the United States since 1983.

This small chip, when inserted at birth, can be found implanted in the thumb, or in the back of the neck.

It is as small as a grain of rice, and undetectable outside of the skin.

The serial number on the chip, is then linked to your Social Security number. You have been tracked your entire life.

“RFID Microchips are essentially a unique ID embedded in your body, and, as we know, numbers can be stolen and data can be hacked,” says University of Wollongong Prof. Katina Michael. “They point to an uber-surveillance society that is big brother on the inside looking out. Governments or large corporations have the ability to track people’s actions and movements, and ultimately even control them.”

This leaked information is expected to cause a major uproar in citizens of the United States born from 1983 to current.

How will you know if you have it? Can you get it removed? Who is tracking us?

These are the questions hoping to be answered, as we learn more about the government’s hidden tactics to control the American Society over the last 32 years.",Fake
22,"The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.

“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”

Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.",Fake
23,"At 12:21 AM EST George Zimmerman was found dead in the backyard of his Florida home. Police say he was stabbed multiple times and had a gunshot wound to the head. A neighbor of Zimmerman said she heard a commotion, looked over the wall and saw him lifeless on the ground. That’s when she called 911.

The murder of George Zimmerman happened Just hours after Zimmerman found himself in a fight provoked by his boasting of being “That guy who shot Trayvon Martin.” Zimmerman became known to America for killing 17-year-old Martin. Martin, an African-American carrying a package of skittles and a can of Arizona iced tea while wandering through a Sanford, Florida neighborhood, was unarmed when Zimmerman fatally shot him on February 26, 2012. On July 13, 2013, Zimmerman was acquitted by a Florida jury, which sparked nationwide protests about the acquittal and Florida’s controversial “stand your ground” law.

Police say, as of now, they have no leads in the murder of George Zimmerman. However, they are confident that his murder had everything to do with his bragging about the death of Martin. Authorities say his constant bragging of the fact that he was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin finally caught up to him. “You can run if you want,” said police chief Robert Gordon. “But your wrongs will catch up to you eventually.”",Fake

The Slovenia born model has voiced concerns over her role as the First Lady of the United States, claiming that she “Didn’t sign up for this.” Sources close to the couple say Melania is not prepared to be ridiculed for the next four years over her immigration status, accent and her husbands infidelities.

“She’s been very upset ever since Donald announced he was running for president last year,” said a woman close to the family. “She wanted a role as a kept woman, not as a woman in charge of being a role model in this country. She is also not prepared to leave her luxurious lifestyle to live in a home as old as the White House. She thinks that the decor is despicable and beyond repair.”

This comes on the heels of Donald Trump’s announcement that he only wants to live in the White House part-time, in a desperate attempt to save his marriage. However, even a part-time residence in the “worn down White House” is still not acceptable for the soon to be First Lady. “She is not used to living in these types of accommodations,” said the source. “She’d be better off just to divorce him, get her child support and alimony, and go on with her life.”",Fake

27,"Washington, D.C. – An announcement was made on Wednesday by the Trump Administration which states a new law that will take effect April 10, 2020 and Americans are shocked and disappointed. According to the announcement, the law concerning the age of consent will be changed across all 50 states and D.C. Currently the law varies in each state with the age of consent being 16, 17, and 18 years old with age provisions and mistake of age defense clauses. Currently, according to lawyers and court officials across the US, these varying laws cause confusion from state to state. This new law is looking to create a uniformed, understood age of consent factor across the entire country.

The lowered age of consent means that an individual can have sex with whomever they wish as long as that person is consenting and they are the same age or older. To have sex with someone under the age of consent is a strict liability crime known as statutory rape. It is often referred to by other names such as sexual assault, sexual misconduct with a child, etc. Many states have age-gap provisions that legalize teen sexuality as long as they are within a certain age range. This new law will do away with that age-gap provision.

In all states, dating, hugging, holding hands and kissing are not illegal. In some states, fondling, groping through close or other such things known as “third-base” is illegal. This new law will make any and all contact legal as long as the child is 13 years of age or older. Now that they have done away with the age-gap provision, a 19-year-old boy can legally have sex with a 13-year-old girl without suffering any legal consequences as long as they both consent to the act.",Fake
28,"First it was Obama Care, Obama Phones, Obama Weed and now Obama Gas. Yes, you heard that right. The White House has quietly used a provision in the law to roll out a nationwide program of free gas for the poor. According to The Detroit News, the Obama administration is using its authority under the Affordable Care Act to “improve transportation routes to hospitals”. This would make it possible for welfare recipients to receive these preloaded gas cards.

This is a $2 billion a year program that will distribute 40 million gallons of gasoline for FREE each year. It will be dispensed at any gas station that participates in the program by accepting this form of payment. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will be operating the network. Over 3,000 gas stations in 38 states have been approved to accept this payment in their stores.

Dori Salcido, assistant DHHS Sec. for Public Affairs explained, “It is not something we are publicizing very much, for obvious reasons. But under the law we are well within our rights to offer this service and we think it’s good public policy. How are people supposed to get to the doctors office if they don’t have gas in their cars? Health insurance is worthless if you can’t make it to your appointments. This is just another fine example of government stepping in and solving big problems.”

This type of program has worked well in oil-rich nations like Venezuela and Indonesia where they subsidize gas for the poor. However, this practice has never been tried here in the United States. This is causing much controversy with some taxpayers who are upset to see their money subsidizing others. One taxpayer, Ross Blake, shared his thoughts, “So basically I’m being punished for not living in the ghetto. I have three kids and a mortgage. Life isn’t cheap for me either. I could use some free gasoline too.” A person like Blake will unlikely be able to use this service.

“Access to this gas card is determined by income,” says Ebony Jackson, a caseworker at he Department of Health and Human Services. “If you are receiving food stamps or cash assistance from the government, you will be approved. All you need to do is apply. The card will supply anywhere from $50 per month to $150 per month in free gas depending on the individual’s income. If they have no income, benefits will max out at $250 per month. This will help the unemployed person go to and from job interviews.”

The gas card scandal was uncovered by Nolan Finley, a conservative Detroit News columnist widely known for his groundbreaking exposé on Obama Phones. Finley says, “There is a blatant economical bias in the program and that is only one of its many outrageous aspects. The President is only trying to increase his popularity. This is something you normally only see in Third World countries. I’ve never been more scared for our democracy.”",Fake
29,"Trump’s first address to the UN General Assembly as President of the United States was highly anticipated. And none were so eager as true American patriots.

We just knew Trump would lay some massive truth bombs not the international community, and he didn’t disappoint!

At one point, Trump took direct aim at the socialism that is so anathema to true American democracy, but which had been championed by our previous president, Barack Hussein Obama.

Addressing the crisis in Venezuela, Trump said:

“I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.”

The assembly applauded, if not only to be polite.

And then Trump dropped the hammer:

“The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.”

BOOM!

The problem, as Trump so rightly noted, is socialism itself, a system that too easily lends itself to megalomaniacs and dictators.

Yeah, after he made $50 million on a book. No shocking thing for us to learn that he would be selling out to the same people that he used to talk sh*t on when campaigning to become president.

That’s not all … Obama is starting his own Leadership summit in Chicago (like the Clinton Global Initiative). Democrats coming to together to bash Trump and investing money to gain back America.

Folks, we need to speak against this corruption. We need to share and let all Americans know what’s really going on.

31,"President Trump promised fiscal responsibility within government, using tax-payer monies wisely.

And he is delivering on that promise.

On Sunday, it was announced that the Trump administration is cutting it’s own budget by $22 million — in effect, Trump is leading the way by cutting funds to the White House, his current residence.

The Democrat party and the mainstream media have been oddly quiet about this big change…

Breitbart reports:

The savings come from a cut in the amount spent on Michelle Obama’s budget as First Lady, an end to the large number of “czars” and so-called “fellowships” that Obama employed, and a smaller White House workforce, Forbes magazine reported.

After the White House released its annual budget report last week, Adam Andrzejewski, president of government watchdog group OpenTheBooks.com, compared the newly reported budget to the last two years of the Obama administration.

Andrzejewski (pronounced And-gee-eff-ski) noted that there are now 110 fewer White House employees since Obama left office, saving nearly $5 million alone. Also, the First Lady’s staff has been cut from 24 staffers to only five. Michelle Obama entered the White House with a staff of 22 costing nearly $2 million annually, up from the $1.4 million spent during the George W. Bush era.

Another area of savings was the elimination of the so-called policy “czars” with which Obama stocked the White House staff. The Trump budget shows not a single “czar” employed for 2017.

Trump also seems to have ended Obama’s shady “fellowship” positions, people responsible for such special programs as Michelle Obama’s “Let Girls Learn” initiative and others. Some of these “fellowship” candidates in Obama’s administration made up to $158,000 annually.",Fake

US Begs Russia For “Mercy” In Syria After Germany Opens American War Crime Investigation

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

A new Ministry of Defense (MoD) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that after Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to yesterday’s telephonic conference with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the American’s “begged for mercy” for their Islamic terrorist forces illegally operating in Syria—but that the MoD ignored by its continuing to obliterate these US-backed terror fighters with massive air power, with Syrian military forces, likewise, ignoring these US-backed militants by rushing pass them as they rapidly advanced across the Euphrates River—while at the same time, Germany has opened a criminal probe into the US illegally supplying these terrorists with weapons. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, during the emergency meeting held in Helsinki (Finland) requested by the US this past week, both Russia and America agreed that the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) should be implemented without exception as a “first bid” to stop World War III—and with the American’s further agreeing that their terrorist forces operating in Syria would not enter the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor—the battle for which the MoD had previously labeled as the “Battle For The Monastery” that they warned “will decide the fate of the world”.

Major General of the Syrian Republican Guard Issam Zahreddine (arms crossed), and his top female aide (cigarette in hand), talk with civilians in the eastern city of Deir ez-Zor on 10 September as they continue to press forward with Russian air cover in the offensive against ISIS and US-backed terrorists across the province. [Note: Americans aren’t allowed to know about the woman commanders in the Syrian Army fighting Islamic terrorists.]

The United States “total capitulation” on Syria, this report explains, is due to their fears over the shocking investigative findings made by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) released this past week detailing how the US has been illegally funneling billons-of-dollars of arms into this conflict zone causing the needless deaths of hundreds-of-thousands, and as they described:

“The Pentagon has relied on an army of contractors and sub-contractors – from blue-chip military giants to firms linked to organized crime – to supply up to US$ 2.2 billion worth of Soviet-style arms and ammunition to Syrian rebels fighting a sprawling war against the Islamic State ( ISIS ).

Arms factories across the Balkans and Eastern Europe – already working at capacity to supply the Syrian war – are unable to meet the demand. In response, the US Department of Defense (DoD) has turned to new suppliers like Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine for additional munitions while relaxing standards on the material it’s willing to accept, according to an investigation by the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN) and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).”

The “Syrian rebels” supplied with these illegal US arms, this report explains, are mainly the al Qaeda linked Al-Nusra Front, and against whom, in 2014, the United Nations passed a resolution stating that all member states “shall prevent the direct or indirect supply sale or transfer to ISIL and Al-Nusra and associated individuals and groups, of arms and related materials”.

Aside from grossly violating this UN resolution not arm these Islamic terror fighters, this report notes, the United States, also, violated German law by secretly transporting these illegal weapons through that European nation onto the battlefields of Syria—and that the German prosecutor’s office in Kaiserslautern has now opened a criminal investigation into.

Upon the OCCRP and BIRN releasing their shocking investigative findings detailing how the United States was committing a grave war crime by funneling these illegal weapons to radical Syrian Islamic terrorists, this report further notes, the US mainstream propaganda media immediately blocked this information from being known to the American people—but after this stunning information went viral on the internet bypassing these propagandists, the CIA funded technology giant Google ordered its YouTube video service division to immediately erase every single Syrian War video—as these videos proved where the weapons being used by Islamic terrorists came from and the horror they inflicted on innocent peoples.

Acting as insane as ever too, this report continues, the true intentions of the United States towards Syria are not yet able to be deciphered by any normal mind either—as nearly immediately after the American’s “begged for mercy” for their Islamic terrorist forces facing annihilation in Syria, and agreed to keep them from entering Deir ez-Zor, both OCCRP and BIRN shockingly discovered that the Trump administration was budgeting another $600 million in illegal arms sales to these Islamic terrorists in order to keep this war ongoing—and with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, also, continuing the “critically flawed” US policy that states “America will not be satisfied as long as Syrian President Bashar Assad is in power”.

Syrian President Assad himself, this report details, exposed this “critical flaw” in US foreign policy in 2015 when he stated:

“Western propaganda has, from the very beginning, been about the cause of the problem being the president.

Why? Because they want to portray the whole problem in Syria lies in one individual; and consequently the natural reaction for many people is that, if the problem lies in one individual, that individual should not be more important than the entire homeland.

So let that individual go and things will be alright.

That’s how they oversimplify things in the West.”

From convincing the American people through the propaganda technique of “Hitlerization” that everything would be “peaches and brandy” in Iraq if only Saddam Hussein was removed from power, and “wine and roses” would flourish in Libya once Muammar Gaddafi was gone, and everything in North Korea would be grand if only Kim Jong-un was deposed, and Venezuela would become a “paradise on Earth” if only President Nicolas Maduro was overthrown, and Russia, too, would be “Gods gift to the world” if only President Putin was killed, this report continues, this mental insanity employed by the United States against its own citizens to believe such childish things would be laughable, except that it’s caused hundreds-of-thousands of needless deaths, not to mention the tens-of-millions of lives shattered by this madness the world over.

Put more bluntly, though, this report says, Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko warns that this “childish and insane” American foreign policy of believing that only a single person in any nation controls its outcome is like “playing with fire”—and who further warned about these insane American’s by stating:

“They are using various means of political and economic pressure; they launch color revolutions and even direct military invasions.

The rhetoric centered on ‘protection of democracy’ can hardly fool anyone now.

The reason behind such operations by the USA and their allies is their desire to maintain their dominant position in the world. As far as the export of democracy is concerned, it only brings other peoples chaos, disasters and wars.

No nation or group of nations can claim the title of carriers of the only authentic and model democracy that should be copied by the rest of the world.

There can’t be ‘pupil nations’ and ‘tutor nations’, every state and every people has the right to its own choice of democracy model, without any outside interference.”

Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matviyenko

And in order to insure that the Syrian people have the right to their own government “without any outside interference”, this report continues, Russian submarines two days ago fired a massive missile barrage that obliterated some of the last Islamic terrorist command-and-control centers in Syria that quickly caused over 1,000 US-backed Islamic terrorist to switch sides and join the Syrian Army, while at the same time, Iraqi forces launched a massive offensive to destroy ISIS terrorists on their side of the Syrian border—thus allowing the Russian Reconciliation Centre in Syria to establish yet another ceasefire zone free from conflict.

Because of Russia freeing Syria from the barbaric rule of these US-backed Islamic terrorists, this report details, over 600,000 Syrian people have been able to return to their homes under the rule of the supposed brutal dictator President Assad—and which the US mainstream propaganda media still refuses to tell the American people about because these truthful facts don’t support their insane, and highly distorted, narrative that every leader in the world they don’t like is a madman hated by his people and only worthy of death.

And as always too, this report concludes, instead of the US mainstream propaganda media telling any truth to the American people about anything, they are, instead, using the same demonization tactics used against other world leaders they detest against their own President Donald Trump—and as evidenced by their outrageously spending more media time bemoaning Trump’s tweet about the ISIS terror attack in London yesterday than actually explaining why it happened—and one of their main communistic spokesman Bill Maher, too, just hours ago, shockingly proclaiming that because none of Trump’s properties were damaged by Hurricane Irma, it “proved that there is no God”.

Elder Patriot – CNN’s admission today that President-elect Donald Trump had indeed been wiretapped raises a serious question as to just who is in the business of spreading conspiracy theories.

It also suggests that Former F.B.I. Director James Comey deliberately perjured himself when he appeared before a House subcommittee and denied any knowledge that Donald Trump – first as a candidate and then as the president – had been wiretapped.

When President Trump tweeted that he had been wiretapped while in Trump Tower the media tried painting him as a conspiracy nut.

CNN pounced on Trump for starting a conspiracy theory and that the wiretapping claim was an “incendiary idea.” CNN was only the tip of the spear. MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The L.A. Times, the entirety of the Deep State controlled mainstream media all joined in discrediting the newly elected president.

Sponsored Links

Except for this:

A full 42 days before Trump’s tweet, the NY Times was the first to report that he had been wiretapped. That was before it was decided that it would be best to deny it ever happened because they found nothing incriminating.

That may not be illegal for a newspaper, especially a rag like the Times, but it is for any member of our intelligence community.

Sponsored Links

The fact that the wiretaps turned up nada meant that Obama had convinced the FISA court to give the NSA and the FBI a fishing license for political purposes. That is the way the Soviet Union operated against their political enemies.

In the United States our government is prevented from opening investigations without just cause. At least we thought so. Foolish us. After the IRS scandal why would we trust the Obama administration to play it straight on anything else? Shame on us.

Essentially the mainstream media chose to twist the emerging facts into knots once it became obvious that James Comey was lying to protect his illegal use of FISA court warrants under orders from President Obama.

From March 5th through March 21st we laid out the case in thirteen columns that Trump had been wiretapped for political reasons, Obama knew about it, and that Trump had trapped Comey into perjuring himself.

For our efforts we were castigated and the social media giants crushed the reach of our articles. We’ve come to recognize that we’re on to something big whenever the social media platforms begin limiting the number of people who get to view our work.

Today our investigative work was vindicated. The mainstream media, led by CNN, was forced to admit that the U.S. government, under President Barack Obama, had wiretapped Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, including his conversations with President Trump — both during after the 2016 presidential campaign.

That leaves Comey facing a perjury charge for lying, under oath, that Trump had never been wiretapped.

There is simply no possibility that Comey, as director of the F.B.I. wasn’t aware that Trump Tower had been wiretapped. If that had happened without Comey’s knowledge it was his job to bring the violators to justice.

Not so shockingly, Comey’s obfuscation wasn’t isolated. Another Deep State operative standing in direct opposition to Trump, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also denied any knowledge of the wiretapping.

If that is the case then who in the hell went before the FISA court, got the authorization from another of Obama’s crooked judges, and then executed the taps?

Question: Why isn’t anyone in any of the 17 intelligence agencies asking this question?

Trump Wins Dangerous “ Pakistan Gambit” That Spells “Total Doom” For US Democratic Party

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An intriguing Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that President Donald Trump has pulled off one the most dangerous “gambit deals” [an action entailing a degree of risk calculated to gain an advantage] ever attempted in modern American political history when he pitted a $225 million military aid package to Pakistan against that nation’s Inter-Services Intelligence (IS) spy agency to pressure them into agreeing to immediately surrender a Pakistani woman to US authorities—and whose testimony could very well spell the “total doom” of the entire American Democratic Party. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

According to this report, President Trump’s “gambit deal” with Pakistan began on 6 April 2017 when the United States Capitol Police (USCP) filed a mysterious report that stated:

“On 4/6/2017 at 0021 hours, with the building closed to the public, AOC informed USCP Rayburn offices of an unattended bag in the phone booth on the 2nd floor. The officer received the open-contents visible bag and prepared a found property report. While reviewing the inventory of the bag contents, the officer found

#1 a Pakistani ID card with the name Mohommed Ashraf Awan

#2 a copy – not original – of a drivers license with name Imran Awan

#3 a copy (front and back) of his congressional ID

#4 an Apple laptop with the homescreen initials ‘RepDWS’ (Representative Debbie Wasserman-Shultz)

#5 composition notebooks with notes handwritten saying ‘attorney client privilege’ and possibly discussing case details below

#6 loose letters addressed to US Attorney of DC discussing the apparent owner of the bag being investigated.

Approximately 3-4 months ago officer was requested by SAA as police presence of 4 individuals being interviewed, including the bag owner. It is unknown to the officer whether he is still employed.”

Wasserman Schultz’s laptop, legal notebook and letters to US Attorney were left in old phone booth like this one in the Rayburn building shortly after Midnight on 6 April 2017

Mohommed Ashraf Awan, this report explains, had previously been identified by the SVR as being a “deep cover” Pakistani IS operative who had embedded himself within the Democratic Party establishment working under his Americanized name of Imran Awan—and who was the top computer information technology specialist for disgraced former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman, and US Congresswoman, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.

Labeled previously by the SVR as a “radical Islamic spy master”, this report details, Imran Awan first infiltrated the US Congress in January 2004 when he became the “information technology director” for Democratic Party US Congressman Robert Wexler—and who, also, over these past nearly 13 years, infiltrated into the US Congress his wife, Hina Alvi, and his brothers Abid and Jamal—with Jamal, at just 20 years old, being given by the Democratic Party in the US Congress the outlandish yearly salary of $160,000.

The Imran Awan spy ring operating within the US Capitol under the protection of the Democratic Party, this report continues, began to unravel this past February (2017) when they were linked to the death of Navy SEAL William Ryan Owens whose secret raid details were leaked—and whom President Trump quickly retaliated against.

With President Trump’s forces closing in on them, this report notes, Imran Awan’s wife Hina Alvi, on 5 March, was able to flee the United States with other members of her family—while Imran Awan stayed behind to liquidate their families vast real estate holdings made possible by the $9 million paid to them by the Democratic Party and US Congress—but who himself was successfully captured by US federal forces on 24 July when he had attempted to flee too—but who was arrested because he pretended to be his wife when requesting a loan from the US Congressional Federal Credit Union—got the loan, and then had this credit union wire $165,000 to Pakistan—with no no questions asked.

Even after his wife Hina Alvi had fled to Pakistan, this report continues, Congresswoman Wasserman-Shultz continued paying Imran Awan up the very day of his arrest—and that she fully intended on continuing to pay him should he have successfully been able to flee.

As to why Congressman Wasserman-Shultz and her Democratic Party continued to pay Imran Awan, this report explains, was due to their fears of what he knew—and that was everything as he had installed a secret server to capture every single US Congress document produced, including intelligence files—and as astonishingly described the Washington D.C. based Daily Caller News Service:

“Now-indicted former congressional IT aide Imran Awan allegedly routed data from numerous House Democrats to a secret server. Police grew suspicious and requested a copy of the server early this year, but they were provided with an elaborate falsified image designed to hide the massive violations.

The falsified image is what ultimately triggered their ban from the House network Feb. 2, according to a senior House official with direct knowledge of the investigation.

The secret server was connected to the House Democratic Caucus, an organization chaired by then-Rep. Xavier Becerra. Police informed Becerra that the server was the subject of an investigation and requested a copy of it. Authorities considered the false image they received to be interference in a criminal investigation, the senior official said.

Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities, the official said. Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox, so an unofficial account was used, meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even though he was banned from the congressional network.”

Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (left) and Imran Awan (right)

Important to about Imran Awan, too, this report says, are that his actions on 6 April when he left for the US Capitol Police to find Congressman Wasserman-Schultz’s laptop Apple computer, confidential attorney notes, and letters to the US Attorney (that were found on the second floor of the Rayburn building – a place Awan would have had no reason to go because Wasserman Schultz's office is in the Longworth building) shows he is in great fear too—and as US Congressman Louie Gohmert confirmed with his recently stating: “If Awan thought he was better off with his crimes documented, that suggests he feared something worse than prison, that this was a matter of life insurance.”

As to what and/or whom Imran Awan would fear more than prison, this report details, is, most certainly, the Clinton Crime Family and their infamous “Clinton Death List”—and who immediately after Awan’s arrest, dispatched one of their top “inner-circle” attorneys named Chris Gowan to defend him—with no one bothering to explain (or the US mainstream press investigating) how a defendant who just told a US Federal Judge that he could not afford an attorney because he was “millions of dollars in debt”, could, 15 minutes later, have one of the most expensive lawyers in America defending him.

Congresswoman Wasserman-Shultz, also, this report continues, employed another high-power Clinton Crime Family attorney named William Pittard, to argue that her Apple laptop computer obtained by the US Capitol Police from Imran Awan as his “life insurance policy” should not be examined—but who wasn’t successful in this childish effort, with Imran Awan even now having for himself a complete copy of this computers hard drive given to him by US Attorneys under that nations “discovery laws”.

In his knowing that this scandal could very well destroy the Democratic Party forever, this report notes, President Trump, also, knew that in order for US federal prosecutors to discover how “wide and deep” the Imran Awan spy ring had penetrated the government, and what other secrets they possessed, “hinged/pivoted” on their securing the testimony of Awan’s wife Hina Alvi—but whom, in late August, Pakistan refused to extradite to the United States.

Immediately following Pakistan’s refusal to hand over Hina Alvi, this report continues, President Trump, on 30 August, employed his “gambit” by his notifying the US Congress that he was putting $255 million in military assistance to Pakistan on hold—while at the same time offering to both Imran Awan and his wife Hina Alvi what some are now describing as a “significant immunity deal”.

Though Pakistan initially slammed President Trump for being “hostile and threatening” towards them, this report says, their powerful Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency, nevertheless, agreed to expedite Hina Alvi’s travel to America later this month—under the condition that she not be arrested or handcuffed in front of her children—but who will have to turn-in her passport when she returns to the United States, with her further agreeing not seek or book any international travel following her appearance in the United States Federal Court.

In order to ensure that Inter-Services Intelligence keeps their side of this agreement to return Hina Alvi to the United States by the end of this month, this report notes, President Trump had his US State Department, yesterday, place Pakistan in a category that lists them as not being fiscally transparent in how they spend American money on their spy agencies—but that after Hina Alvi reaches the US, will be rescinded, thus allowing Pakistan to receive their $225 million in military assistance currently being blocked.

With the US mainstream propaganda media still blacklisting the information of the, most likely, greatest scandal in US history from being widely known to the America people, and who never report on any scandals involving the Democratic Party, this report continues, their being able to ignore this any longer is coming to a quick end—and when compared to the “fake news” Russian scandal, is not only real, but growing in its ferocity too.

This report concludes with SVR intelligence analysts predicting that President Trump will “weaponize” this scandal in order to totally destroy the Democratic Party—with Trump expected to drag it out for months to its climax during the 2018 US midterm elections that the Democratic Party has only managed to raise $21 million in donations from small donors for, and whose former DNC Chairman, Howard Dean, stunningly just admitted about America’s young voters “these people are not Democrats”—and whose nominal leader, Hillary Clinton, has just released a new book showing that she still doesn’t know why she lost to President Trump—but that any Russian school-child knowing simple mathematics could explain by their showing Clinton the fact that Trump won 2,622 counties in America, while she only won 490—and that no matter how much the Democratic Party and their mainstream media sycophant elites don’t like to face it, there are simply not enough coastal seats to be won for Democrats to ever win the US Congress again.

Russia Declares “State Of War Now Exists”: Orders “Masterchain” Destruction Of America

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers

An apocalyptic sounding new report released in the Kremlin today by the Security Council (SC) affirms that a “state of war” now exists between the Federation and the United States—with all members, including President Putin, authorizing a “Masterchain” counter attack against the Americans that, if fully successful, could see that nations entire economy destroyed by the end of October. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]

.

According to this report (and as we warned about in our 23 July article New US Law To Remove Trump From Power And Declare War On Russia “Will Be Met By Force”), President Donald Trump, yesterday, was unable to withstand the “Deep State” forces arrayed against him, thus causing him to sign a new sanctions regime against Russia that specifically targets all of Russia’s major industries for destruction—and that Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev quickly responded to by grimly stating:

“The signing of new sanctions against Russia into law by the US president leads to several consequences. First, any hope of improving our relations with the new US administration is over. Second, the US just declared a full-scale trade war on Russia . Third, the Trump administration demonstrated it is utterly powerless, and in the most humiliating manner transferred executive powers to Congress.

This shifts the alignment of forces in US political circles.

What does this mean for the U.S. ? The American establishment completely outplayed Trump. The president is not happy with the new sanctions, but he could not avoid signing the new law.

The purpose of the new sanctions was to put Trump in his place. Their ultimate goal is to remove Trump from power. An incompetent player must be eliminated.

At the same time, the interests of American businesses were almost ignored. Politics rose above the pragmatic approach. Anti-Russian hysteria has turned into a key part of not only foreign (as has been the case many times), but also domestic US policy (this is recent).

The sanctions codified into law will now last for decades, unless some miracle occurs.”

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announces full scale trade war now exists between Russia and US

. With the American “Deep State” now firmly in control of the United States, this report continues, President Putin’s orders, issued in late 2016, to “prepare for war” against the United States have now been accelerated—and none more fearful than “Operation Masterchain”.

Though the propaganda Western media focused exclusively on President Putin’s bomb shelter preparations, this report details, they failed to inform their peoples that Russia has the most extensive network of bomb shelters to protect against nuclear war the world has ever known—while the United States has no protection for its citizens as it doesn’t even spend any money on them.

In October 2016 when President Putin ordered these preparations for war, this report says, the Western propaganda media, also, failed to report to their peoples that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation had developed a “Masterchain” prototype and successfully made its first test transactions—and that is one of the most fearsome weapons of global economic warfare ever invented.

Managed by FinTech under the governance of the Central Bank of Russia, this report explains, the Federation has become the first nation in the world to digitalize its entire domestic and international economy under the “blockchain” distributed database system (the most important invention since the Internet itself)—and that Tunisia became, in January 2016, the first nation in the world to convert its currency into.

Though many in the world know about crypto currencies (such as Bitcoin and Tunisia’s eDinar), this report details, very few understand the staggering implications of its underlying “blockchain” infrastructure—that is the most secure method of transferring wealth (of all kinds) ever invented, is impervious to hacking and/or spying, and by the day is revolutionizing our entire planet.

With the United States placing its entire economic future under the full control of a vast global military structure, that requires continual conquest of other nations, and has wasted trillions-of-dollars of that nations wealth, this report continues, Russia, instead, invested its economic future in the “Blockchain Revolution”—that is called “Masterchain” and whose crypto currency has been named “Gas”.

Once fully operational, this report notes, “Masterchain” and “Gas” will provide to the world the most secure and secret method of transferring wealth history has ever known—and will be impervious to sanctions, spying and all Western interference.

As nearly all Western economists are warning that the American stock markets are heading for an October 2017 crash of epic proportions, this report says, President Putin has today ordered both “Masterchain” and “Gas” to “immediately prepare” for this global economic crisis offering “safety and security” to everyone seeking to protect their wealth and investments.

And with trillions-of-dollars flowing into “Masterchain” and “Gas”, this report explains, the United States will be unable to find any global liquidity to sustain itself—as it is already being crushed by its massive $19.9 trillion debt—that when distributed among its 326.7 million citizens, sees each of them owing their government a staggering $60,192 for each and every one of them.

Russia, however, this report continues, has never matched the warmongers in America and has kept defense spending at a fraction of what the US spends—thus allowing the Federation to have a miniscule national debt of only $157.9 billion—that can be paid off instantly from Russia’s $412 billion of savings—and whose 143 million citizens owe nothing—and all of whom live in a nation twice the size of the United States having a total national wealth of $75 trillion.

.

With the “Deep State” now firmly in control of the US Congress, this report warns, their bloodlust shows no signs of abating either as they are now, also, preparing several defense bills that would require their Department of Defense to violate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with Russia through the development of medium-range missiles banned under the accord—with one of their top Democratic Party lawmakers, US Senator Ben Cardin, triumphantly declaring “We make the laws, not the President of the United States”.

And as President Trump just hours ago warned that relations between the US and Russia are at an all-time and very dangerous low, and his adding that the American people should blame the US Congress for this turn of events, this report concludes, his sudden announcement that he is going into seclusion for 17 days (beginning Friday) has raised further alarms among Security Council members wondering who exactly is now in control of the United States.

Election Season 2016

Ruth Bader Ginsberg was nominated to the highest court in the nation by then-President Bill Clinton in 1993. Donald Trump was a reality TV show star and real estate figure, with a worldwide string of hotels.

During the election season, when Ginsberg was asked about then-candidate Trump, she responded: “I can’t imagine what this place would be — I can’t imagine what the country would be — with Donald Trump as our president … For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be — I don’t even want to contemplate that.” [The New York Times, “Ruth Bader Ginsburg, no fan of Donald Trump, critiques latest term,” July 10, 2016.] A few days later she doubled down on her comments and went even further, calling him a ‘faker’, expressing disbelief that he had not released his tax returns, and saying “he really has an ego.” [CNN]

Candidate Trump then commented on her comments in a New York Times interview, saying, “I think it’s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly … I think it’s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it… That she should be saying that? It’s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.” He then followed up his comments with a tweet calling on her to resign.

On her part, Ginsberg then released a statement expressing regret and acknowledging the importance of apolitical behavior for justices, and said, “In the future, I will be more circumspect.”

Indeed, it is historically unusual for a Supreme Court justice to give a personal opinion on any political candidate or process.

The Trump Presidency and Replacement Debate

President Trump took office in January of 2017, at which time Justice Ginsberg had been serving for 23 years. After the election, things between the President and the Justice were relatively quiet. Ginsberg had several trips to the hospital and her health began declining, spurring a debate about the Constitutionality of when and with whom to replace her, were she to pass away before the end of President Trump’s term.

When Justice Ginsberg did pass in September of 2020, it was reportedly her dying wish that her replacement not come until the new president had been sworn in. Many opinions on both sides of the aisle were expressed by a myriad of public figures and politicians, and 200-year-old letters by Presidents were unearthed and interpreted. When the time came for the sitting President to make a decision, he chose to disregard both that historical analysis and the justice’s last words, and expressed doubt in the veracity of Ginsberg’s reported dying wish. After releasing a statement heralding Ginsberg as a ‘titan of the law’ who ‘led an amazing life, he then gave an interview in which he made clear his intention to replace her, stating that he believed that the report that Ginsberg did not wish to be replaced until the next Presidential term (remember, at this point, the election had not been held, so the next President was not yet decided) was a fabrication authored by Democratic leaders in the House and Senate.

President Trump went on to nominate Amy Coney Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor, who was confirmed by a purely partisan vote.",Fake
49,"From the moment he came down the escalator to announce his candidacy for the US presidency, Donald Trump became the object of much criticism among celebrities from around the world. Here are a few topics celebrities commented on and what a few of them said.

Coronavirus

Actress Debra Messing criticized Trump and his followers for Trump’s attitude toward the virus on Twitter, saying many would die, including Maga loyalists.

Actor, writer, and director Rob Reiner tweeted that Trump needed to be stopped from speaking publicly about the virus, then removed from office.

In a tweet, Trevor Noah said Trump “bumbled” his way through handling the virus.

Captain America star Chris Evans criticized Trump via tweet for not taking questions after a speaking event, asking for answers about Coronavirus from Trump and not VP Pence.

Mega-star entertainer Bette Midler criticized Trumps’ handling of information, suggesting he should not be believed about his test was negative because he lies about everything, according to her tweet.

Writer and comic Larry David said watching Trump speak daily on the virus turned him into a maniac who yells at the tv because of what Trump says.

Actor Don Cheadle criticized Trump’s “Chinese virus” label, suggesting Trump was trying to deflect attention from his response onto China.

Russia Collusion

During and after the Trump-Putin summit that took place after the Russian collusion story took hold, many celebrities had much to say. The criticism mostly centered on Trump’s open questioning of American intelligence concerning Russian interference in the election.

Actor/director Zack Braff tweeted “treason is trending” during the summit.

Actor Jeffrey Wright suggested the summit was a show, sarcastically asking Kim Jong-Un to join the charade.

Rob Reiner criticized Trump for meeting with Putin but refusing to meet with Robert Mueller, who was investigating the President’s alleged connection to Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Comedienne Chelsea Handler made homosexual/homophobic insinuations about the men’s relationship during the summit.

Bette Midler called Trump a traitor for not addressing Russian interference in the election with Putin. Actress Rosanna Arquette echoed that sentiment.

Actor Chris Meloni outrightly called Trump an agent of Putin.

Famed actress Mia Farrow stated that Trump’s “first allegiance is to Russia.”

Iconic actor Carl Reiner accused Trump of treason for “denigrating our… FBI… and praising Putin.”

Figure skater Adam Rippon called Trump “Putin’s puppet.”

Some politicians opined as well.

Senator Elizabeth Warren said by embracing Putin and questioning the FBI’s intelligence gathering, Trump “betrayed America’s institutions… and attacked our democracy.”

Senator Jeff Flake remarked on Trump standing with the Russian dictator while blaming the US for Russian aggression.

Representative Nancy Pelosi said Russia must have had blackmail material to make Trump behave the way he did.

A few celebrity television news channel personalities added their influential voices to the chorus.

MSNBC anchor Joy Reid remarked on Trump’s refusal to address Putin directly about Russia’s interference only to shift attention to Hillary Clinton.

CNN’s Lawrence O’Donnell noted Trump’s lack of anti-Putin bravery.

Repeat Offended

A few celebrities had long-standing feuds with President Trump across many issues along the timeline.

Model Chrissy Teigen took umbrage at President Trump’s description of her as John Legend’s “filthy-mouthed wife,” using profanity to describe the fact that Trump didn’t tag her on his Twitter attack.

The feud between Donald Trump and comic turned daytime talk show host-turned co-host of ABC’s The View Rosie O’Donnell goes back years to O’Donnell’s characterization of Trump as a snake-oil salesman and flared up as soon as Trump announced his candidacy. Commenting on it more than once, O’Donnell still holds that it is Trump who will not let the feud end.

Second, only to O’Donnell is Robert DeNiro. DeNiro began by insulting Trump personally as a candidate then moved into attacking his policies, even stating his belief that Trump would engineer a third term for himself",Fake
50,"Many unanswered questions remain about the 2016 U.S. President Election in which Donald Trump upset Hillary Clinton. The election was controversial and divisive on social media, where true and false political gossip was widely spread.

One of the countless election memes that were circulated online gave the impression that three years earlier Hillary Clinton made a statement to bankers the nation needed a business leader such as Trump as president.

What Did Hillary Supposedly Say About Trump?

In October 2016 an infographic spread on social media that Hillary Clinton said the following in 2013: “I would like to see people like Donald Trump run for office; they’re honest and can’t be bought.” Accompanying the quote was a photo of Donald standing next to Hillary, which was taken at the future president’s wedding to Melania in 2005.

Trump and Clinton Relationship

It should come as no surprise that either the Trump or Clinton families would say something nice about the other, as the two families became friends during Bill Clinton’s White House years. Trump praised and defended President Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He also had positive things to say about Hillary in interviews when she ran for president the first time in 2008.

Even after the extremely negative 2016 campaign from both parties, Trump still spoke highly of the Clintons when they attended his inaugural luncheon in 2017, saying he had great respect for them. Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton particularly have had a close friendship over the years. Photos also show Donald Trump at a golf course with Bill Clinton.

So it’s not hard to believe that it would be very possible for Hillary to praise family friend Donald Trump three years before anyone knew what to expect about Obama’s successor.

What Fact-Checkers Say

The meme was debunked by fact-check sites and several major news sources that identified the origin of the fake quote as a discontinued Israel-based website. The website’s “About Us” page clarified the site mixed news with satire. Interestingly, several other satire sites were taken as fact during the election, leading to what could be argued as the biggest spread of political misinformation in the history of propaganda.

Both Factcheck.org and Politifact rate the quote as false – meaning it wasn’t a real quote by Hillary, as it apparently was meant as satirical humor. It’s no more true than saying Donald Trump made Mike Pence wear a training collar throughout his Presidency.

The closest thing Hillary said to the fake quote during her actual speech was “You know, I would like to see more successful business people run for office.” She went on to say “you don’t have to have 30 billion, but you have a certain level of freedom.” She never mentioned Trump at all in the entire speech.

The website claimed Hillary made a positive comment about Trump on October 29, 2013, at Goldman Sachs. Even though she actually did speak to the investment firm on that date, the transcript revealed the quote in question was nowhere to be found. The transcript of that speech was posted online by WikiLeaks.

Conclusion

As much as some people want to believe Hillary promoted Donald Trump for President in a 2013 speech, the quote was fabricated by a hybrid news/satire website. It’s one of many examples of how satire or another form of entertainment can be confused as truth for some people.",Fake

55,"TRUMP TOWER — With his poll numbers among black voters hovering around 1%, presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump reportedly tapped actress and FOX News contributor Stacey Dash as his “Negro Outreach Program” Ambassador.

“She connects with that group,” said Trump, “and she’ll be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. We’re lucky to have her. She’s controversial, but she’s one of the good ones.”









Dash recently created controversy by calling Grey’s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a “plantation slave” after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called “cultural appropriation.”

Trump said now more than ever, “especially with ‘Crooked Hillary’ siphoning off my blacks,” minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November.

“You know what will happen,” said Trump. “The media will come down on me for saying ‘my blacks.’ They did that in California with that African-American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I don’t’ care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach.”

One of those groups is the transgender community, Last June, the Clueless actress’ comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who “can’t decide what they wanna be that day” should go to the bathroom “in the bushes.”

Sources say Trump’s camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, Trump’s short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.

“She’s very well-informed. She’s quite affected. We’ve been looking into it,” said Trump.

When asked if the term “Negro” was a proper term to use in 2016, a Trump spokesman said, “The trouble with saying ‘African-American’ is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them aren’t even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico.”

“To be inclusive, we decided against ‘colored,’ since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to ‘black,’ because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with ‘negro.’ It’s historically accurate. Nothing racist about it.”

“Not everything is about race,” added the spokesman. “We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all.”

57,"President Barack Obama spent eight years warning about the supposed threat of man-made global warming, which included massive and catastrophic rising sea levels. Conservative Republicans and President Donald Trump, we were told, are on the “wrong side of history” when it comes to climate change.

But the Obama family’s actions speak louder than words. And what the Obamas just did contradicts all their talk about climate change.

The Boston Globe reports the former first family is ready to spend tens of millions of dollars on a property right along that same ocean line we were warned about. Realtors aren’t sharing details yet, but the rumor is that they are purchasing a luxurious location in Martha’s Vineyard, along with other expensive, less-populated regions to the north.

Considering Obama never held a real job in his life, this is an extraordinary move:

Word around the island is that the Obamas, who’ve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Martha’s Vineyard — Harvard professors Henry Louis “Skip” Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few — and they would like to own a place of their own on the island. The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused “up island,” looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (It’s worth noting that the Obamas have always rented “up island,” including for a two-week stay this summer.) No one’s talking, least of all realtors, but we’re told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market. Both are still available — but they don’t come cheap. Sotheby’s International Realty and Hancock Real Estate in Chilmark are listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million. The descriptions for each read like something out of a fairytale: “The vast acreage and exquisite dune-fringed sands give the sense of a world apart in an idyllic landscape which has remained virtually unchanged over the centuries. Perched on a southwest-facing ridge, the potential homesite commands glorious views to the ocean’s brilliant blue waters and sunsets in the midst of this sublime seaside paradise of pastoral coastal heathlands and high dunes.”

And as shown by real estate websites, the property would be the exact wrong place to buy a home if you believe Al Gore’s predictions about rising sea levels:

The lots, such as the one shown above, cost approximately $15 million… and that’s just the cost before any home is built. The luxurious properties must be built to withstand erosion of land and require unique painting to avoid damage due to the surrounding salt water. And none of that includes serious issues involving licensing, zoning, permits, and ground preparation.

Another reason to laugh at the Obamas is they may be building on top of land that was stolen from Native Americans!

“The Obamas need to check all permits, and [see] if their land can be subdivided, and if it’s on Wampanoag land,” says Julianne Kavoussi, who has owned a home in the Edgartown part of the Vineyard for 20 years. The Wampanoag are Native American people who, she says, own a good portion of Aquinnah.

It wasn’t long ago that we learned Al Gore’s house uses 34 times the amount of energy used by the average American household. Now, the Obamas are being the hypocrites we always knew they were.

59,"More evidence of voter fraud in New Hampshire has surfaced. It is now believed that over 5,000 out-of-state voters may have voted for Hillary Clinton on election day in New Hampshire because the state allows same-day registration.

New Hampshire was a close race in the 2016 Presidential election. Hillary won the four electoral votes, however; it took a week to count the votes because it was tight. Hillary received 348,521 votes, while Trump picked up 345,789. Trump lost by 0.4 percent.

As previously reported, Hillary Clinton’s former top campaign lawyer, Marc Elias is behind a New Hampshire lawsuit to block a law which would force people who are registering to vote to show a form of I.D. Figures.

The Democrats are pulling out all the stops to prevent voter I.D. laws because without illegal aliens, dead people or people being bussed in to vote, the Democrats would never win another election.

TRENDING: Croatian Politician Says Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau Is Acting Like a Dictator ""of the Worst Kind"" to His Face

More than 6,500 people registered to vote in New Hampshire on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, and since then the vast majority have neither obtained an in-state license nor registered a motor vehicle. Conservatives say the state’s same-day registration is an invitation for fraud because of loose proof-of-residence rules. New Hampshire House Speaker Shawn Jasper, a Republican, issued the numbers Thursday based on inquiries he made to the Department of State, which oversees elections, and the Department of Safety.

Here are the numbers:

⦁ 6,540 people registered and voted on Nov. 8, based on presenting out-of-state licenses. ⦁ As of Aug. 30, about 15 percent (1,014 of the voters) had been issued New Hampshire driver’s licenses. ⦁ Οf the remaining 5,526, barely more than 200 (3.3 percent) had registered a motor vehicle in New Hampshire. New Hampshire law gives drivers 60 days upon establishing residence to obtain a state license. But more than 80 percent of voters who registered on Nov. 8 using out-of-state driver’s licenses, or 5,313 of them, neither had a state license nor registered a motor vehicle almost 10 months later.

It is well known that people are bussed in to vote in New Hampshire. This is why the Democrats are fiercely working to stop any investigation into vote fraud and are working to prevent any type of voter I.D. laws. Strict laws would have tipped New Hampshire in Donald Trump’s favor.",Fake
60,"HUD Director Dr. Ben Carson found a big economic pitfall by the Obama administration.

The mainstream media has neglected to report on a BIG find by Dr. Ben Carson. The Trump cabinet is a winning cabinet.

Dr. Carson dug into the agencies records in a sweeping audit wherein he found substantial bookkeeping “errors”, which only prove either the incompetence or the corrupt nature of the previous administration led by former-president, Barack Obama.

The HUD report found $500 billion in fraud and mismanagement in the government agency.

What We Found TRENDING: Croatian Politician Says Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau Is Acting Like a Dictator ""of the Worst Kind"" to His Face The total amounts of errors corrected in HUD’s notes and consolidated financial statements were $516.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. There were several other unresolved audit matters, which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to express an opinion. These unresolved audit matters relate to (1) the Office of General Counsel’s refusal to sign the management representation letter, (2) HUD’s improper use of cumulative and first-in, first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds, (3) the $4.2 billion in nonpooled loan assets from Ginnie Mae’s stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support, (4) the improper accounting for certain HUD assets and liabilities, and (5) material differences between HUD’s subledger and general ledger accounts. This audit report contains 11 material weaknesses, 7 significant deficiencies, and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.

We took a screenshot of the .pdf file that outlines the findings by Dr. Carson and his team:

62,"Hillary Clinton’s delusions continue. It’s been almost a year since the election, and now Hillary’s blaming married women who voted for Donald Trump for her loss to the president back in November.

Still unwilling to take any responsibility for her loss to Donald Trump, Hillary continues to play the blame game. So far, she’s blamed everyone from her most trusted advisor, Huma Abedin, to the infamous socialist and fellow democrat Bernie Sanders, for the disastrous campaign and ridiculous ideas she championed last year. But she doesn’t stop there anymore. Now it’s the fault of married women who voted for Donald Trump.

According to the Daily Wire, the quintessential modern feminist Clinton says women were too scared to stand up to their husbands, boyfriends, and fathers, who told them to vote Republican, and since, clearly, women have no agency or ability to think for themselves, they listened. Of course, that’s according to Hillary. But she blamed socialist women as well. Clinton made the outrageous claims in an interview with NPR,where she also blamed the so-called “Bernie Bros” for bullying Democratic women into avoiding the more moderate Clinton in favor of the socialist, Bernie Sanders.

They just weren’t inspired by your message,” NPR’s Rachel Martin said during an interview with Clinton, out to promote her litany of excuses…er…recently released book, What Happened. “I think it’s a lot more complicated than that,” Clinton answered. “I did win the women’s vote. I didn’t win the vote of white women, but I got more white women votes than Barack Obama did,” she said. “Women will have no empathy for you because they will be under tremendous pressure — and I’m talking principally about white women — they will be under tremendous pressure from fathers, and husbands, and boyfriends and male employers, not to vote for ‘the girl,’” she said. –Daily Wire

But Clinton also said that even though women liked and respected her (an observation American women might disagree with generally) they were too afraid to stand up to the “oppressive Patriarchial hand” that often “forces” them to hide their allegiance to womankind. Clinton also tried pretty hard to convince NPR that she is taking the blame for her loss, but no one is buying this snake oil anymore:

“I take ultimate responsibility for the loss,” Clinton said. “I was the candidate. I was the person whose name was on the ballot. And I’ll never get over that.”

And even though she lost to one of the most hated candidates of all time, Hillary Clinton is refusing to go away. “I’m not going anywhere. I have the experience, I have the insight, I have the scars that I think give me not only the right but the responsibility to speak out,” Clinton said.

63,"For some time now, the Alternative Media have been saying Washington, D.C., is a nest of satanists.

Given the fact that D.C. is where the politically powerful congregate, it stands to reason that the city would be a special target of satanists. What better way than to corrupt and bring down the United States, still the most powerful country in the world?

Last year, we learnt that John Podesta, a longtime Clinton associate who chaired Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, partook of a satanic ritual called spirit cooking dinner — a “sacrament” in Thelema founded by British satanist Aleister Crowley whose motto was “Do As Thou Wilt,” in which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are ingested. (See “Evidence that Hillary Clinton and her associates are satanists“)

Yesterday, we learnt that Hillary Clinton who, were it not for the grace of God, would be the U.S. president now, admitted she had wanted to make and stick pins into voodoo dolls of her critics.

Today, you’ll find out about a very powerful D.C. woman who put hexes on her enemies.

A curse is an expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall another (or a place or object). A hex is more than a curse: To hex someone is to call upon a supernatural power, by means of “magic” or witchcraft, to bring ill on another. According to Wikipedia, the word “hexing” comes from the German word for witchcraft.

Sally Quinn, now 76, is a former Washington Post (WP) reporter who became the third (and last) wife of the late WP executive editor and later, vice president, Benjamin Bradlee. Bradlee became a celebrated and national figure during the presidency of Richard Nixon when he challenged the federal government over the right to publish the Pentagon Papers and oversaw the publication of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s stories documenting the Watergate scandal.

Together, from their marriage in 1978 until Bradlee’s death in 2014, the couple were among D.C.’s most powerful, dominating the city’s social scene as its gatekeepers.

In 2006, Quinn wrote that her parents were religious “but didn’t go to church,” and that she was an atheist since the time she was a small child because she could not believe in a God who allowed evil and bad things to happen to people, including her (unnamed) sickness when she was ten years old.

John Nolte reports for Breitbart, Sept 12, 2017:

“For nearly 50 years, the entire social and political world of DC revolved around this couple. Bradlee and Quinn were the New Camelot (his career took off in large part because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy), the Gatekeepers of who was in and who was out, the Elite Deciders among our Ruling Class with the extraordinary power of the Washington Post, and by extension the rest of the mainstream media, to abuse and weaponize their will against the rest of us. Well, to put it as bluntly as possible, we are now learning that the Queen of Camelot is an occultist, a witch of sorts who honestly believes (according to her own new memoir) that she murdered three innocent people through the dark art of the hex: a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinn’s boyfriend; a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of her, who decades later died of cancer; a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. […] Quinn’s other acts of admitted wickedness include plotting to break up Bradlee’s marriage (which she did) and using the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will.”

Quinn “practiced the occult in the most demonic ways imaginable well into adulthood.” She finally stopped hexing others, not out of a sense of remorse, but because she thought she was karmically responsible for the unusual illness of her and Bradlee’s only son, Quinn.

Quinn Bradlee was born in 1982 (when Sally Quinn was 41 and Ben Bradlee was 61) with a rare and incurable disease called velo-cardio-facial syndrome, aka DiGeorge syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion or Shprintzen syndrome. Caused by the deletion of a small segment (30-40 genes) of chromosome 22, the syndrome occurs in only 1 in 4,000 people with afflictions that can include congenital heart problems, specific facial features, frequent infections, developmental delay, learning problems, cleft palate, kidney problems, hearing loss, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and Graves disease.

Nolte points out that what is almost as troubling as Sally Quinn’s witchcraft is “the matter-of-fact way in which the Washington Post informs us of this bombshell” under the chatty headline, ‘‘Sally Quinn’s hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son”. Nolte writes:

“We have just discovered that one of the primary movers and shakers of the last half-century is a practicing occultist, and… Nothing. Nobody cares. The information is dropped as though Quinn’s tell-all is the usual-usual about plastic surgeries and sex. Worse still, our Ruling Class is now joking about Quinn putting a deadly hex on President Trump. […] Let’s just say it out loud… The most powerful people in our country are either outright occultists, are comfortable with witchcraft and Satanism, or are moving and shaking among those who are. Whether or not you believe in the power of the occult, that does not matter. Also beside the point is whether or not the Podestas and Quinn and those calling to have Trump hexed believe. What we do know is that these people have completely rejected any notion of a loving God, and moved towards darkness. Furthermore, we also know that this darkness is not about consenting adults behaving badly amongst themselves. Rather, this is about them attempting to harness a power to control others, to manipulate events to their will, to hurt or outright kill those who offend or insult them.“

What is remarkable is that, although he was born with a hole in his heart and underwent heart surgery when he was three months old, after which he spent many years in and out of hospital and attended special schools for severe learning problems, and although he never received a religious education, Quinn Bradlee is a believing but non-church going Christian.

In 2006 when Quinn was 24 years old, he told his mother that he believes in God. He said:

“My image of God is what Michaelangelo painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. God is a man stronger and more powerful than everybody else. I also believe that if you think about God, if you say his name all the time, then you will believe in him. It will be in your subconscious. . . . I knew you and Dad were not very religious people . . . . I didn’t really understand that you didn’t believe in God until a few years ago. I didn’t know what ‘atheist’ meant. It’s a very harsh word, very ugly word. It’s like calling a black person the “N” word. . . . Everything happens for a reason. Maybe it’s God’s plan for me to go through this because I can handle it. . . . In a way, believing in God is like having a girlfriend that you love and care about. You feel safe with her. You feel safe with God, the way you would with your girlfriend. When you get married she will be with you in sickness and in health. That’s what I believe God will do when I’m going through the hard times of life.”

Now 35 years old, Josiah Quinn Bradlee is a filmmaker, author and advocate for the disabled.

64,"The lawsuit brought about by Bernie Sanders supporters against the Democratic National Committee and its former chairperson Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been dismissed after a court conceded that the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz rigged the primaries—but were well within their rights to do so—seriously.

After first assuming all the plaintiff’s allegations were true, for the purposes of weighing their claims, Judge William Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on several grounds. The plaintiffs alleged fraud on the part of the DNC in three different ways:

1. The DNC did not remain unbiased as evidenced through the DNC emails Wikileaks published.

2. Donors to the DNC were defrauded because they donated to Bernie Sanders as a Democrat candidate and the fix was in for Hillary Clinton.

3. The potential for identity theft was demonstrated when the DNC failed to keep its database of donors and their personal information confidential.

As Michael Sainato writes in the Observer, Zloch, dismissed the lawsuit after several months of litigation during which DNC attorneys argued that the DNC would be well within their rights to rig primaries and select their own candidate. “In evaluating Plaintiffs’ claims at this stage, the Court assumes their allegations are true—that the DNC and Wasserman Schultz held a palpable bias in favor Clinton and sought to propel her ahead of her Democratic opponent,” the court order dismissing the lawsuit stated.

Zloch concluded the plaintiffs failed to prove they were materially affected by the alleged bias with which the DNC engaged. He wrote:

“The Court must now decide whether Plaintiffs have suffered a concrete injury particularized to them, or one certainly impending, that is traceable to the DNC and its former chair’s conduct—the keys to entering federal court. The Court holds that they have not.”

The overwhelming opinion of those who have actually read WikiLeaks’ leaked DNC email database appears to be that the DNC, Wasserman-Schultz, and the mainstream media all colluded to ensure Clinton would earn the DNC nomination. This was evident on numerous occasions, many of which were caught on live video and openly admitted.

As The Free Thought Project has extensively reported, influential donors to the DNC are suing their political party for fraud in the 2016 presidential election where they say their candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, was discriminated against. High-ranking members of the DNC, by way of Wikileaks’ DNC email publications, were caught favoring Hillary Clinton over Sanders and actively working to subvert his chances at winning the party’s nomination.

Judge Zloch dismissed the lawsuit on technicalities (several of the plaintiffs lived outside of the court’s jurisdiction) and precedents (donors to nonprofits have no legal recourse as to what the organization does with the donations). Zloch never really addressed the claims of the plaintiffs, only whether or not they had a legal claim for damages.

Zloch admonished the plaintiffs his court was not the place to air their grievances. Instead, they should have done so at the ballot box, inside the DNC, and to work inside the system—a system they clearly believe to be rife with corruption. Zloch wrote:

“This Order, therefore, concerns only technical matters of pleading and subject-matter jurisdiction. To the extent Plaintiffs wish to air their general grievances with the DNC or its candidate selection process, their redress is through the ballot box, the DNC’s internal workings, or their right of free speech—not through the judiciary.”

Zloch dismissed the case against the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz by declaring, “the Court finds that the named Plaintiffs have not presented a case that is cognizable in federal court.”

One of the plaintiffs in the case, Jared Beck, went off! Here’s what he had to say in response to the dismissal and it’s epic! His rant starts at the 9-minute mark.

His reaction describes the deaths of process server Shawn Lucas, DNC data manager Seth Rich, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Beranton Whisenant alludes to the Deep State, and points the finger of blame at the Military Industrial Complex.

“What really disappoints me about our society, H.A., is the fact that we had two witnesses die in this case, and I still have these f***ing people who call themselves ‘journalists’ mocking us… denigrating us for being concerned about that. Ya know, it goes beyond a lack of awareness in this country. This country has a vicious, corrupt core… and the MOST vicious, corrupt people are sitting in D.C. right now, running the show and forming the media elite and establishment that surrounds and protects them, and promulgates their bullshit all over the airwaves. And I am sick and f***ing tired of living in this country and having those be the people that run the show. We see our clients lose in court, all the time. We see them get shafted by the healthcare system, get shafted by this country, and nobody in this country gives a f*** about them, who’s in the leadership… Let me tell you something: I know that those problems… the problem in this country, in terms of corruption… I know that it’s so deep-seated… It’s taken root over many, many decades, and it’s not going anywhere any time soon. But my HOPE—my hope in filing this lawsuit was that at least it might be some kind of spark to get things rolling, so that by the time my kids are adults in this society, they’re not living under an immoral, oligarchic, tyrannical piece-of-shit government that f***ing goes to war in MY name, with my tax dollars, on a perpetual basis and f***ing incinerating people, and I have NO f***ing channel to STOP it. And as an American, I am ashamed. I am ashamed to call myself an American. And let me tell you something else: There were people in Nazi Germany who didn’t know what the f*** was going on, either… They were f***ing clueless. They were f***ing brainwashed. And I’m not making this comparison because of any bullshit comparison between Trump and Nazism that’s going around that the mainstream media wants you to believe. What I’m talking about is the REAL government we have in this country. And in my view, they are morally equivalent, or worse, than the government of Nazi Germany… Because they’ve been going on longer, and they’ve been f***ing over not just everybody in THIS country, but around the world. And I’m f***ing sick of it, as a human being.”

The dismissal of the DNC voter fraud lawsuit of 2017 will go down in history as a whimper in the annals of unsuccessful movements against the Deep State and its actors. But, perhaps, Beck’s comments will remain as a testament to just how powerful the establishment is, and the lengths to which they will go, including allegedly murdering anyone who gets in their way.

65,"Black-and-White Evidence That Proves US Government Engaged in Forced Sterilizations, Mind Control, Weather Modification, False Flag Operations and Igniting Wars (Videos)

% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.





(N.Morgan) When vital government documents are declassified or leaked, the evidence held within those pages are useful tools in getting to the truth of what is really going on in the world.

This evidence also assists in validating researchers and investigators who are often shut down, censored and dismissed as “conspiracy theorists.”

The internet is quickly becoming a digital censorship grid, where corporate technological behemoths like Google (who owns YouTube) and Facebook will rig algorithms (which control search engine results and news feeds) to elevate the information they want you to see and bury the information they don’t want you to see.

Amazon also plays a part in this emerging multinational corporate technological oligarchy, and you may remember they have been caught censoring books in the past (such as No One Died at Sandy Hook by Jim Fetzer) by refusing the book sales on their platform.

Declassified documents are tangible and vital pieces of evidence that expose the shocking extent to which groups of people, using and hiding behind the concept of “government”, have committed egregious crimes against humanity. It’s hard for naysayers and censors to deny the authenticity of government declassified files which show our history is full of conspiracy fact, not conspiracy fiction.

Declassified Files #1: Operation

Think that World War II ended with the defeat of the Nazis?

Think again. They didn’t get defeated; they just went south (Argentina) and joined the ranks of their conquerors (US, UK, Russia) in a dirty deal of legal immunity for inside information.

The German scientists, technicians and engineers had made brilliant and groundbreaking advances in many fields in the leadup to and during the war, and the victors didn’t have a moral problem with the Nazi weapons of destruction … the only problem was that the brilliant scientists were on the wrong side.

The US got a sizeable portion of these Nazi scientists (around 1500) and smuggled them into NASA and the CIA, where some of them such as Wernher von Braun went on to make a name for themselves. Thus, the US willingly allowed its military and intelligence agencies to be infected with Nazi ideology, which continues to this day.

The declassified docs relating to Project Paperclip or Operation Paperclip are here.

Declassified Files #2: The Escape of Hitler and Other Nazis to Argentina

The mainstream narrative is that at the end of WWII, Hitler committed suicide in Berlin in a bunker. It’s a nice story, but apparently, that’s all it is – a story.

In his book Hitler in Argentina: The Documented Truth of Hitler’s Escape from Berlin, author Harry Cooper produced a slew of astounding evidence that Hitler and other top Nazis such as Martin Bormann traveled in German submarines all the way to Argentina.

Some of the evidence which supports the truth of this astonishing claim is found in these FBI declassified docs.

The article FBI Quietly Declassified Secret Files Attesting Hitler Fled to Argentina in 1945 contains further information.

“Along with the FBI documents detailing an eye witness account of Hitler’s whereabouts in Argentina, more evidence is coming to light to help prove that Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun did not die in that bunker.

In 1945, the Naval Attaché in Buenos Aires informed Washington there was a high probability that Hitler and Eva Braun had just arrived in Argentina.

This coincides with the sightings of the submarine U-530. Added proof comes in the form of newspaper articles detailing the construction of a Bavarian styled mansion in the foothills of the Andes Mountains.

Further proof comes in the form of architect Alejandro Bustillo who wrote about his design and construction of Hitler’s new home which was financed by earlier wealthy German immigrants in Argentina.

… [an] archeologist from Connecticut State, Nicholas Bellatoni was allowed to perform DNA testing on one of the skull fragments recovered from the bunker. What he discovered set off a reaction through the intelligence and scholarly communities.

Not only did the DNA not match any recorded samples thought to be Hitler’s, they did not match Eva Braun’s familiar DNA either.”

Declassified Files #3: Operation Northwoods

Operation Northwoods was the outrageous plan for the US military to attack its own people and cities (Washington DC and Miami) as a false flag operation to frame Cuba.

It was a pretext to invade Cuba.

The 1962 declassified US Joint Chiefs of Staff Memo is entitled “Operation Northwoods – Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba.”

In its own words, the document states that a “series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.”

Luckily JFK had the nous to reject the plan; by 1962, he had discerned the insidious influence of Military Intelligence Complex upon his presidency.

The declassified docs for Operation Northwoods are here.

Declassified Files #4: CoIntelPro

CoIntelPro has become a famous word of its own, derived from the full operational name Counter Intelligence Program. This was a program run by the FBI under Hoover which started in 1956.

CoIntelPro was a series of undercover operations that targeted people and groups the US Government deemed were a problem, such as the communist party, other far left groups, civil rights groups, far right groups (e.g. the KKK) and individuals activists such as Martin Luther King.

The scope of CoIntelPro was broad: it involved monitoring, surveilling, infiltrating, discrediting and disrupting.

Although then Attorney General Robert Kennedy authorized some spying, the FBI was given an inch and took a mile (much like today’s spy agencies), clearly overstepping the bounds of legality. It became a way for the government to intimidate and stifle dissidents.

Declassified docs on CoIntelPro are here.

Declassified Files #5: Operation Mockingbird

Operation Mockingbird was a CIA disinformation project to infiltrate and covertly control the mainstream media.

It began in the 1950s under then CIA director Allen Dulles.

The declassified files (most are classified and secret, but a tiny fraction are here) show how the CIA infiltrated the mainstream media and had its pieces inserted into TV, newspapers and journals everywhere as “news” when they were nothing more than lies and propaganda.

Richard Salant, former President of CBS News, once said that “our job is to give people not what they want, but what we decide they ought to have.”

Mockingbird was famously exposed in the 1975 Church Committee hearings with CIA Director William Colby testifying that over 400 CIA agents were active in the US media, to control what was reported through American mainstream television, newspapers and magazines.

Journalists worldwide are still on the payroll, and some were brave enough to talk about it, such as the late Udo Ulfkotte.

Declassified Files #6: Operation MKUltra

Operation MKUltra has become so infamous that the term is basically synonymous with mind control. The “MK” of MKUltra stands for mind kontrolle (German spelling of control), with a nod to the German Nazi scientists who were brought in under Paperclip and developed it for the CIA.

In 1953, CIA agent Richard Helms (later CIA director in 1966) chose Dr. Sidney Gottlieb to run the TSS (Technical Service Staff) to develop truth serum drugs, hypnotic techniques and mind control techniques, with the purpose of creating spies, couriers and assassins.

Eisenhower approved using Nazi scientists and Jewish victims as guinea pigs. MKUltra was so large it had 149 sub-projects. By 1953, the emphasis of MKUltra was LSD (see below), but by the 1960s, this had changed into biological radio communications.

Helms later destroyed much of the MKUltra archive when he left in 1972, but some declassified files remain.

Declassified Files #7: Operation Midnight Climax

Operation Midnight Climax, one of many MKUltra sub-projects, used paid prostitutes to lure people into CIA safe houses in San Francisco, Marin and New York.

There, they were surreptitiously given a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass.

This was not the first time, nor the last, that the US Government used drugs and other substances with which to experiment upon unsuspecting individuals.

The point was to study the effects of LSD and gain research on the potential military and intelligence uses of sexual blackmail, surveillance technology and mind-altering drugs.

Some of the declassified files are available here.

Declassified Files #8: CIA Drug Smuggling

The CIA has for many years used illegal drugs to fund its illegal operations. Drugs are often one of the secret motivation behind wars.

Vietnam is part of the Golden Triangle of heroin-producing opium poppies, Afghanistan is also home to huge swathes of opium poppies, and after the US invaded many Central and South American countries, it took control of the cocaine production operations there.

In 1996, journalist Gary Webb exposed the connection between the CIA, cocaine and the Nicaraguan contras.

In the early 1980s, the CIA pushed the sale of cocaine in Los Angeles to help finance their covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. (Also see: The Clinton Body Count)

You can read some of the declassified files on the CIA’s connection to the drug trade here, including excerpts from Oliver North’s notebook obtained under the FOIA.

North writes that Air Force General Richard Secord told him (North) that “14 M to finance [the arms in the warehouse] came from drugs.”

Declassified Files #9: Operation Gladio

Operation Gladio, which still continues to this day, is the codename for a clandestine NATO “stay-behind” operation in Italy during the Cold War.

The CIA spearheaded Gladio under the pretext of preventing the spread of Soviet communism in Europe.

The name gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword.

Gladio came to refer to a whole range of stay-behind cells and groups in Europe, although originally, Operation Gladio was the Italian branch.

Gladio became famous when then Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti talked about it.

Gladio involved the Freemasons, Mafia members and the Vatican, who all united with the CIA and NATO in a holy war against communism.

Operation Gladio was responsible for some horrible atrocities and false flag attacks in Italy, such as the bombing of Bologna train station in 1980.

Today, even the Western-backed fighters in Nazi Ukraine and Syria are basically Gladio fighters.

Declassified files on Gladio can be found here.

Declassified Files #10: Forced Sterilization Programs

The United States Government has a long and sordid history of using its own people as guinea pigs and unwitting subjects for experimentation, much of which was done without their knowledge or consent. Some of this came in the form of forced sterilization programs.

The article, Forced Sterilization of Native Americans, describes a particular program aimed at Native American Indian women:

“During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization was imposed upon Native American women in the United States, usually without their knowledge or consent, by the federally funded Indian Health Service (IHS), then run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).

It is alleged that the existence of the sterilization program was discovered by members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) during its occupation of the BIA headquarters in 1972.

A 1974 study by Women of All Red Nations (WARN), concluded that as many as 42 percent of all American Indian women of childbearing age had, by that point, been sterilized without their consent.

A subsequent investigation was conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), though it was restricted to only four of the many IHS facilities nationwide and examined only the years 1973 to 1976.

The GAO study showed that 3,406 involuntary sterilizations were performed in these four IHS hospitals during this three-year period. Consequently, the IHS was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services in 1978.”

Declassified Files #11: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment

One of the darkest episodes in the history of the US Government, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment was a nefarious clinical study conducted by the US Public Health Service which began in 1932 and lasted all the way to 1972.

The point was to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African American men who thought they were receiving free health care from the government.

It involved knowingly giving the men syphilis without their knowledge, telling them they just had “bad blood”, then watching them as the disease progressed. The researchers (or perhaps better put, sadists) deliberately didn’t treat the men with penicillin which was found in the 1940s to be an effective cure for syphilis.

Meanwhile, numerous men in the study died of syphilis, 40 of their wives contracted the disease and subsequently 19 children were born with congenital syphilis.

Declassified files are here.

Declassified Files #12: Operation LAC and Operation Dew

Human experimentation has not just been limited to the injection of diseases and sterilization.

There have also been tests upon the population which have involved spraying entire areas with pathological agents — sometimes natural, sometimes man-made biological warfare agents.

Two examples of this are Operation LAC (Large Area Coverage) and Operation Dew, both carried out by the US Army Chemical Corps in the 1950s, both of which involved dispersing tiny zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCdS) particles (which were fluorescent) and plant spores (lycopodium) from an aircraft over much of the country.

The goal was to ascertain the dispersion and geographic range of the sprayed agents.

The Government said it was safe at first, but “according to the National Library of Medicine’s TOXNET database, the EPA reported that Cadmium-sulfide was classified as a probable human carcinogen.”

Some of the declassified files are here.

Declassified Files #13: Project Sunshine

Body snatching and experimentation upon dead bodies (cadavers) is also a documented fact when it comes to governmental crimes.

During the 1950s, the US AEC (Atomic Energy Commission) and US Air Force conducted a study on the global health effects of fallout from nuclear weapons testing.

The AEC wanted to learn more about how strontium-90 (a radioactive isotope of strontium) affected human tissue and bones, so they secretly collected (stole) over 1500 tissue samples from the bodies of dead babies and young children from around the globe – without consent.

Project Sunshine was declassified in 1959.

Declassified Files #14: Operation Popeye

All those who are still skeptical about the reality of chemtrails, cloud seeding and geoengineering programs will want to review this evidence.

Operation Popeye was a weather modification program in Southeast Asia (mainly Laos and Vietnam) from 1967 to 1972.

The purpose was to aid US efforts in the Vietnam War.

Specifically, it was a cloud seeding operation which aimed to extend the monsoon season (targeted over areas of the Ho Chi Minh Trail) by inducing rain over the “infiltration routes in North Vietnam and southern Laos” and therefore to “interdict or at least interfere with truck traffic between North and South Vietnam” – as written in this memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs (Kohler) to Secretary of State Rusk.

Chemtrails were also utilized in WWII as a smoke curtain in battle. Check out the footage below:

Declassified Files #15: Iran Flight 655

The US and Iran have been on tense terms for a long time.

In 1953, the US decided to target Iran with one of its now famous regime change programs to overthrow the democratically elected Mossadegh and replace him the puppet dictator Shah who was happy to give the US and UK a cut of the Iranian oil profits.

Then, during the Iraq-Iran War of the 1980s, the US took the side of Iraq against Iran.

Towards the end of the 1980s (July 3rd, 1988 to be exact), Iran Air Flight 655 (a commercial flight) was travelling along a standard flight path through Iranian airspace on the way to Dubai.

Just a few minutes after taking off, it was shot down by the US Navy, killing all 290 people on board.

The Navy lied and stated they thought Flight 655 was an attacking fighter plane, and that they had attempted radio contact but received no response.

However, declassified documents (here) reveal a different story.

The truth was that the US only used emergency radio frequencies but not air traffic control frequencies, and also that the Navy cruiser registered the plane was climbing at the time, not descending as an attacking plane would be. Some of the files were declassified in 1988 and others in 1993.

Declassified Files #16: Unit 731

This one is another shocking event in the annals of governmental crime, although in the case the perpetrator was the Japanese Government.

Unit 731 refers to a covert biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Japanese Army located in China during World War II.

Under the command of General Ishii, the Japanese committed war crimes and lethal human experimentation upon around 300 people, mostly Chinese victims (though there were some Mongolian, Russian, Korean and Allied POWs too).

At the end of the war, the Japanese were caught, but in a familiar tale, the US traded immunity for data (a common theme which also happened with Project Paperclip).

The Unit 731 researchers were secretly given immunity by the US in exchange for the data they gathered through human experimentation.

Wikipedia quotes Hal Gold on Douglas MacArthur (Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces), who wrote to Washington that, “additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as ‘War Crimes’ evidence.”

Some of the declassified files are here.

Declassified Files #17: Gulf of Tonkin Incident

Vietnam was a brutal and devastating war, that changed a generation of young people and forever marred history because it was a war deception and greed, hidden under the veil of patriotism and liberty.

LBJ, fresh from his role in the Kennedy assassination, decide to plunge the US into war in 1964 by “making shit up.”

He claimed that the US ships were being fired upon int he Gulf of Tonkin, but it was an utter lie.

In 2005 and 2006, NSA documents were declassified showing that the second Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was used as a justification for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (which led to the Vietnam War), never happened.

Declassified Files #18: Project Stargate

Project Stargate was the code name for a secret US Army unit established in 1978 at Fort Meade, Maryland, by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and SRI International (a California contractor).

The goal was analyze psychic phenomena (remote viewing, ESP, clairvoyance, astral travel, etc.) and see if they could be weaponized for military and intelligence purposes.

The original founders of the program were Russell Targ, Hal Puthoff and Ingo Swann – nicknamed the “Psi Spies” by the late Jim Marrs.

The Project had various predecessors and offshoots (such as Gondola Wish, Grill Flame, Center Lane, Sun Streak and Scanate) until 1991 when they were consolidated and renamed under the umbrella term Stargate Project.

At one point, the late Major General Albert Stubblebine was in charge, the same one who was outspoken in exposing the 9/11 false flag operation, and who was the husband of health and nutrition activist Dr. Rima Laibow.

The CIA terminated Project Stargate in 1995, deeming that it had provided no use.

Declassified Files #19: Project 1794

Project 1794 is black-and-white proof that the US military, specifically the USAF (US Air Force), was developing UFOs or flying saucers.

In 2012, the USAF revealed that its Aeronautical Systems Division had plans to produce a UFO craft in the 1950s.

The craft vehicle was designed to reach speeds of Mach 4, an altitude of 100,000 feet and have a range of over 1,000 nautical miles. The project was abandoned in 1961.

Declassified Files #20: Majestic 12 or MJ-12

Majestic 12, also known as MJ-12 or MJ 12, was a shadowy group which was allegedly given the task of overseeing the “alien question” during the aftermath of WWII, the start of the Cold War and the aftermath of the 1947 UFO Roswell crash.

Many researchers and whistleblowers have drawn the conclusion that MJ-12 was the core group within other groups which controlled access to extraterrestrial technology.

Some of its members included famous people such as Vannevar Bush, who was also instrumental in the development of weather manipulation programs (as exposed by Peter Kirby in his research on what he calls The New Manhattan Project).

Respected UFO researcher Bob Wood (together with his team including son Ryan Wood, UFO researcher Nick Redfern, UFO researcher Stanton Friedman, Timothy Cooper, Jim Clarkson and the late Jim Marrs) has made a website with many Majestic docs available.

You can read these MJ-12 files here. They have their own system of rating the documents for authenticity.

The document above was authenticated MJ-12 document written by former CIA chief Allen Dulles.

67,"Investigative journalist, Sharyl Attkisson was one of the many people targeted by the Obama administration for surveillance.

Her personal computer and CBS laptop were hacked after she began filing stories about Benghazi that were unflattering to the Obama administration. Attkisson wrote a New York Times bestseller documenting this called ‘Stonewalled’.

On Wednesday, Attkisson wrote an Op-Ed for The Hill titled, “It looks like Obama did spy on Trump, just as he apparently did to me” in response to the CNN report that Obama’s FBI indeed wiretapped Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Attkisson said in her op-ed that many in the media are missing the bigger story with the wiretapping reports. The Obama administration spied on political opponents, journalists and members of Congress and asks if the intel agencies are indeed weaponized.

She also points out a pattern that every time CIA Director John Brennan or DNI head James Clapper were caught spying, they would falsely deny such accusations.

Attkisson points out that the media is happy to push propaganda for the government rather than report the truth:

Then, as now, instead of getting the bigger story, some in the news media and quasi-news media published false and misleading narratives pushed by government interests. They implied the computer intrusions were the stuff of vivid imagination, conveniently dismissed forensic evidence from three independent examinations that they didn’t review.

Attkisson concludes:

Officials involved in the surveillance and unmasking of U.S. citizens have said their actions were legal and not politically motivated. And there are certainly legitimate areas of inquiry to be made by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. But look at the patterns. It seems that government monitoring of journalists, members of Congress and political enemies — under multiple administrations — has become more common than anyone would have imagined two decades ago. So has the unmasking of sensitive and highly protected names by political officials.

Where to, one might ask?

Well, as reports suggest, Hillary is packing her back to fly to good ole Canada.

Talk about feeling the need to chill!

Hillary and husband, Bill Clinton will pay a visit to the country, alongside daughter Chelsea and two grandchildren, residing at an estate in Quebec, known as Manoir Hovey.

Whether this is a long-term commitment or a short-term agenda is still unclear, but Hillary does have many reasons to abandon her homeland.

The timing is also immaculate, as Barack Obama decided to also leave for Indonesia, when the Susan rice case reached a boiling point.

After Rice’s testimony was delayed, which must have come as devastating to Obama, who was looking to avoid the drama.

The Democrats sure are travelers by nature!

Once the news of Hillary traveling to Canada broke, the Internet had a blast commenting.Take a look:

While the Hillary investigation is set to kick off, she felt like this was a good time to leave, but has to back to the U.S. for her book publishing, scheduled for September. I guess she left many loose ends, which are now putting her in the inevitable position to face her doings.

US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe. Exclusive: US investigators wiretapped Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election https://t.co/xt8FGd4uOk pic.twitter.com/bF4HwF7rdK — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 18, 2017 Is Paul Manafort Trumps Judas?

2. Trump's campaign manager may go to prison. https://t.co/uceLOmhJIp — Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) September 18, 2017

According to CNN:

The liberal media is shrieking in an attempt to turn the story against Trump by being shocked at the fact a candidate would be spied upon. Totally forgetting the fact that they have spent months spinning the fact that no surveillance ever took place.

So many questions. Was Manafort cooperating to hurt Trump? Why was a FISA warrant issued and who signed off on it?

CNN Continues:

It is unclear when the new warrant started. The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort, the sources told CNN. As part of the FISA warrant, CNN has learned that earlier this year, the FBI conducted a search of a storage facility belonging to Manafort. It’s not known what they found.

78,"RICHMOND, Va. – An updated version of the twenty-dollar bill featuring the American Confederate general Robert E. Lee is scheduled to make its debut in a handful of southern states later this month, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Treasury announced on Tuesday.

The new bill includes a portrait of the middle-aged Confederate general on its face while the reverse side features a scene depicting the Second Battle of Bull Run. “We are pleased to announce that the new twenty-dollar bill will make its debut on Monday, September 11th, in eleven states, including South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Texas,” Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis announced during a press conference Tuesday morning.

The decision to replace the existing twenty-dollar banknote, which entered circulation in 1996, comes as President Donald J. Trump continues to work diligently to reverse his predecessor’s policies. “We had Barack Obama, who – for eight years and without any prior authorization from Congress – decided he was going to put Harriet Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “Well, Wolf, he can’t do that,” Conway argued, continuing, “President Trump cares very deeply about the American people and he has said, time and time again, if we’re going to do it, we’ll replace one great man with another.”

Less than a week after Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin pointedly avoided voicing support for a $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing – the agency responsible for producing paper currency – released a statement saying “current color and shading capabilities limit our ability to adequately depict [Harriet Tubman] on most forms of U.S. currency.” The statement went on to say that increased shading would make the bill “too dark” and, therefore, more susceptible to counterfeiting.

Treasury spokesperson Keith Davis said the redesigned twenty-dollar bill is scheduled for a nationwide release on January 19, 2018, and will coincide with the 211th anniversary of General Robert E. Lee’s birthday, as requested by the White House.",Fake
79,"With the exceptions of capitalism, God, and low taxes, there is nothing that Democrats detest more than having to address questions about Seth Rich. That is because the sharpest investigators from the best forensics colleges have detected a cover-up. Signs that the DNC is mired in this guilt all the way up to their neckties and pearl necklaces mean nothing to most liberals who just say, “it was proven as fake news.”

Well, no it certainly was and is not! In fact, a paper trail has unveiled a new twist regarding the whole affair.

Disobedient Media tells us today that “a report from America First Media Group appears to show” that payments were made to a private security company called “Crowdstrike” and that these ominous payments “coincided with the dates of two mysterious deaths.” That would be the deaths of Seth Rich (DNC staffer and likely leaker to Wikileaks) as well as “process server Shawn Lucas.”

Many who care about justice remember the name of Rich, but few recall the odd facts surrounding the death of Lucas. He met his end “after he attempted to serve former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz with papers regarding the DNC Fraud Lawsuit.”

The lawyers for the plaintiffs in that case “sought protection from the court” by “citing both Seth Rich and Shawn Lucas’ deaths, as well as that of Beranton Whisenant Jr. and others.”

To put this into perspective, most people have seen crime documentaries where the guilty party says, “no comment” to questions like “did you kill your best friend?” There is no doubt of the guilt when such answers are given to such easy questions, and this is basically the analogy that can be used to describe how citing such concerns highlighted this.

America First Media Group shows that the first payment made was what they called “preemptive measures” and occurred on May 5th, 2016. Whoever left his paper trail also later added to that a payment to Crowdstrike that totaled “$98,849.84” and that “took place on July 11th.”

The report tells us that “the relationship to this date happens to be the day after DNC Data Director of New Voter Registration Seth Rich was murdered. The final payment to date is August 3rd, 2016. This coincides with another murder in the District of Columbia. Shawn Lucas, who died on August 2nd of last year, was the DNC Process Server and close friend of Seth Rich.”

Are we seeing evidence of actual blood money RIGHT BEFORE OUR VERY EYES?

Lucas and Rich were friends, a fact which must not be overlooked. If one of those two was suspected of telling the other anything that the DNC wanted to be left unsaid, according to the “James Bond” logic that we seem to be witnessing, they both would have to go.

Thanks to the Atlantic Council, George “America LAST” Soros is tied to Crowdstrike, which is yet another strike against them. Also, Adam Carter has found reasons to suspect the firm as having a “possible role in the creation of the Guccifer 2.0 persona and possible fabrication of Russian hacking in coordination with the DNC.” This is a lie which has haunted the current White House since day one.

What we have here is a rare and vivid look into actual liberal corruption.

If for any reason anyone on either side of the aisle (love Trump or hate him) still thinks that there is no leftwing cover-up happening here: let us imagine that George W. Bush and his team had such a paper trail after a GOP leaker is murdered who was talking to Jullian Assange about a Republican scheme to steal the White House.

Even with the facts that we have now, Bush would have swung from the highest tree that the media could have hung him from. Even if it was only half-true, the media circus would have savored the ratings talking about it nonstop. “A PAPER TRAIL OF DEATH FOR BUSH” the headlines on CNN would read, would they not have?

THAT is how one knows that there is a cover-up happening.

80,"The United States legislators have continued to follow Europe’s path towards complete censorship. European lawmakers have long placed laws that forbid the use of hate speech and make the offenses legally extremely punishable. Congress is looking to do the same thing in the United States that would comments against certain minorities legally punishable. Representative Barbara Comstock (R-VA) has proposed a bill that would protect Muslims from Islamophobic comments and she is not alone as many in the House are hoping the bill gets through.

The bill is designed to protect minorities from hate speech, a vague category of crime that seems only to protect minorities while the majority is subject to any criticism. It would not be surprising to find out that this bill would be supported by Democrats, as they make up the majority of support, but there are a few virtue signaling Republicans that think that limiting speech is a good thing.

The Democrats and liberals in the United States have always sought the removal of free speech as it allows forces in control to silence any internal opposition that may be directed against them. Republicans should know better than to advance a bill that would take away someone’s ability to criticize something, especially a religion.

The bill also calls for new task forces to be created that would seek out and prosecute individuals who violate the proposed law. This means that our representatives want to create secret police forces appointed by bureaucrats to carry out laws that prohibit the criticism of Islam. If one begins to think of religious police who come to silence or kill journalists, activists, or anyone who disagrees with Islam’s culture of domination then one would have the proper idea of the kinds of forces that are going to be appointed.

These task forces already exist in Europe as many in the United Kingdom suffer from their own government prosecuting them simply for stating that child marriage is common in Islam. Child marriage, polygamy, and religious intolerance were not what built this great nation and to have our culture become irrelevant is not only unacceptable, it is treason. These representatives should feel ashamed of themselves for even suggesting religious police forces would be a good idea and somehow does not cross the line between church and state.

Unfortunately, this bill looks like it was manufactured by Islamist political groups across the United States. These groups like CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are huge international organizations with vast networks of associates and activists that work to undermine national governments in order to better establish Sharia law.

They will influence public opinion by calling anyone who speaks ill of Islam an Islamophobic, even though Muslims constantly disrespect and call for the deaths of Jews, Hindus, Christians, and often times other Muslims. If this law is passed then it basically condone Sharia law in the sense that blasphemers can have a legal case brought against them.

Once organizations and police forces across the nation are able to enforce laws against those who speak ill of Islam, it will grant a foothold to those who want other punished by Sharia as well. Citizens of the United States did not immigrate from around the globe just to have Sharia law dominant over their lives.

This is the same Sharia law that oppresses women and religious minorities to conditions that violate all international human rights. This law can never be placed over the Constitution as even the tiniest foothold will allow Islam to spread and begin to control the lives of all Americans.

America has always placed our most sacred right as the right to speak freely. This often times calls for people to listen to opinions they probably disagree with but nevertheless must be heard the same. It protects the rights of minorities to speak out against atrocities that are occurring as well as allows even the most outrageous political voices to be heard.

It is placed above all other rights for a reason because our founding fathers knew the dangers associated of a religion tied to a government structure. Islam can not be placed above other religions as it will give it a place to legally prosecute any who violate Sharia law, a drastic violation of any American’s Constitutional rights.",Fake
81,"The long awaited presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is set to take place on Monday, September 26, 2016. As many have recognized, Hillary’s health is withering away nearly as quickly as her chances of winning this election.

In fact, Hillary’s health has gotten so bad lately, she cancelled a major rally she had planned in North Carolina for Tuesday afternoon. Naturally, the Clinton campaign offered no response for why they cancelled an event, but we all know the reason.

Hillary has also canceled several events after she collapsed at Ground Zero on 9/11. The campaign indicated that Hillary overheated , the flu , had pneumonia. She literally has so many illnesses and health problems, it is almost impossible to keep up with which sickness she has this week.

On Saturday night, we all saw how pale, frail, and ghostly Hillary appeared at 10pm when she spoke about the New York City bombings. She appeared absolutely exhausted and unfit to stand strong for a country that desperately needs a leader during these tough times.

Now, it has been reported by associates close to the Clinton campaign that Hillary is attempting to cancel the debate where she is set to face Donald Trump for the first time. She may argue health issues or something else that doesn’t make sense, but she is working closely with her team to avoid having to debate in a few days.

The sources argue that Hillary feels as if the game is too close right now, and she is trying to just “run out the clock” and stay as hidden as possible before Election Day. The sources argue there is simply too much heat on Clinton and she quite possibly is one or two bad stories away from being permanently beaten.

The sources spoke on the terms of anonymity, but they have indicated that they will provide more information when it becomes available. They indicated that they clear her schedule for the rest of the week so that she can rest, but they still are concerned about the fact the Hillary will have to stand for hours during this debate.

They are also trying to push for a “seated” debate with chairs as opposed to standing. This could get very interesting in the coming days as we monitor the situation.

Whether Hillary participates in the debate or not is a moot point. We can all clearly see the Clinton campaign is literally imploding with under 50 days until the Election. The campaign is running from fire to fire, and they should all blame Hillary for carrying so much baggage, hiding so many lies, and keeping so many things secret.

Things have gotten so bad that even Clinton’s spokesman can’t even come up with answers for her failures. Watch him absolutely crash and burn in this interview from Wednesday morning. How pathetic is this?

https://twitter.com/mrwalsh8/status/778638166358167552

Hillary has been in public office for 30+ years, she has no one to blame other than herself for her failures.

While we wait to hear from the Clinton campaign, we can clearly see that we are winning this election. The American people are uniting from all walks of life to ensure that this election isn’t won by Hillary.

Hillary spent $50,000,000 in August on negative ads against Trump and she still dropped in the polls by 5 percentage points. We are winning this election, but we cannot afford to let go of the lead. We have to continue to share articles and promote Donald Trump. This country needs Trump now more than ever, and the American people across the country are voicing their support.

We are very close to winning the election and ending the Clinton Cartel from ruining this country any longer, but we cannot let up now. We need to win this by as much as possible so they cannot take it away from us.

We will keep you posted whether or not Hillary drops out of the debate Monday, but either way, we can clearly see she is in full panic mode and is afraid to face Doanld Trump!",Fake
82,"“The steak tartare was a bad decision.”

Here is what we know so far:

First, Hillary Clinton clearly has serious medical problems and is receiving unknown or inexplicable treatments for it.

Dr. Drew, a CNN favorite, had his show cancelled with days of expressing his concerns.

Second, her health problems mainly manifest as speech problems, uncontrollable coughing, or inappropriate laughter, problems walking, and a bizarre tongue ulcer.

Third, she is professionally and personally connected to Marina Abramovic, a bizarre performance artist, and therefore has a surprising number of connections to the occult and to the satanic art/magick ritual known as Spirit Cooking.

Fourth, Spirit Cooking includes disturbing instructions to cut into one’s own flesh, “eat the pain,” and mix bodily fluids like breast milk, urine, blood, semen, and even feces for “spiritual” drinking. Fifth, the usual assumption is that she has Parkinson’s disease, or might simply be a functioning alcoholic who stumbles and acts out in public.

But there is another possibility.

According to Wikipedia, “kuru” is a rare, incurable neurodegenerative disorder (aka, brain disease) which was prevalent among the Fore people Papua New Guinea in the 1950s and 60s. Kuru is a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, caused by prions, which cause abnormal folding of specific proteins mostly found in the brain. In this respect, kuru is very similar to Creuztfeldt-Jakid Disease (CJD), better known as “Mad Cow Disease”.

The Rachel Maddow Disease

Don’t worry about the medical jargon; the point is that there is a very unpleasant disease called kuru that is transmitted by ingestion of human blood (specifically the “prions” in the blood). These prions then cause more and more deformities in the brain’s proteins over time, ultimately leading to death.

“#ImWithHer … #ImWither”

On the left is a card from the 1990s role-playing game called “Illuminati,” which is debated to this day because many of its cards seems to predict current events in the Globalist Agenda.

In any case, the term kuru derives from the Fore word kuria or guria (“to shake”), a reference to the body tremors that are a classic symptom of the disease. It is also known as the “laughing sickness” due to the pathologic bursts of laughter which are a symptom of the disease. It is now widely accepted that kuru was transmitted among members of the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea via funerary cannibalism. Kuru causes physiological as well as neurological effects that ultimately lead to death.

Neurological disorders?

Check!

Bodily tremors?

Check!

Laughing fits?

Check!

Ritual consumption of human tissues?

Check!

In the first stage of kuru, victims exhibit unsteady stance and gait, decreased muscle control, tremors, and speech problems.

In the second stage, the patient is incapable of walking without support and suffers ataxia and severe tremors.

Furthermore, the victim is emotionally unstable and depressed, yet has uncontrolled sporadic laughter.

In the final stage, the patient is incapable of sitting without support…

…suffers severe ataxia, is unable to speak, is incontinent…

…has speech problems, is unresponsive to his or her surroundings, and develops chronic ulcerated wounds.

A screenshot of Hillary’s tongue during the DNC this summer.

A chronic tongue ulcer.

Ultimately, an infected person usually dies within three months to two years after the first symptoms, often because of pneumonia or pressure sore infection.

Pneumonia?

Why, yes, that’s exactly the explanation that her campaign gave to the public after she froze up and collapsed in New York on 9/11!

Here’s one other visual oddity.

An illustration of prions in action, causing tangled protein deformities.

Am I only one this prion illustration reminds of a presidential candidate’s logo?

Or, as one journalist noticed last year…

“Can’t spell ‘Hillary’ without ‘ill’!”

In pop culture, the zombie apocalypse in the video game Dead Island is blamed on an aggressive type of kuru that causes skin degeneration as well as psychotic rage.

Ironically enough, some years ago, Hillary herself noted the connection between violent video games and cannibalism.

Is any of this 100% conclusive? No, I admit that, of course. But it does remind us of two bits of wisdom.

First, the outside gradually comes to reflect the inside of a person. Over time, our thoughts and our habits express themselves–impose themselves–on our physical appearance and health. So if a person is filled with lies and dark thoughts for decades, it will manifest in her appearance. An internally corrupt–or rotten–person will inevitably show external, bodily corruption, as well.

Second, we can run from our actions for a long time, but eventually the consequences catch up with us. If Hillary ever had ingested the “ingredients” in Spirit Cooking, not even she is above the law of consequences.

If nothing else, we as American should NOT elect someone with this many spiritual and medical problems.

We must be wiser.

We must elect Donald Trump to Make America Great Again!

83,"Hillary Clinton’s health scares have been extremely prevalent the past couple days. Even though the Clinton campaign has stated that she has pneumonia, there are people that think otherwise. In fact there is a claim that she might have Parkinson’s disease.

A Republican state representative for New Hampshire made the claim first, on his Facebook account. In fact there was a twitter post by a King Robbo that has evidence to this. “JUST BEFORE SHE COLLAPSED! Her aid asks her to “Squeeze My Fingers” A neurological test! NOT PNEUMONIA! …”

Now there is more evidence for this. Daniel Tamburello, the co-chair of the Veterans For Trump group, has explained that his father had Parkinson’s and pneumonia is common for people who suffer from it.

“They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”

Temburello created a Facebook post detailed what he knows about the disease.

“My Dad has had Parkinson’s since 1989, so I know a bit about the disease. Hillary has been rumored to have Parkinson’s for some time, as one of the theories to what ails her. (Personally I would surmise it is more than one illness).”

While not as educated as a doctor, Tamburello has probably talked to doctors over the past 25 plus years, so he does know what to suspect. Since it was a loved one that has had it, you can be assured that Tamburello is going to pay special attention.

“It has now been admitted she has pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the most common secondary conditions that occurs, and is a high degree secondary issue complicating Parkinson’s patients’ health that causes eventual mortality – again, very common to have Parkinson’s patients die of pneumonia.”

Since he has been dealing with a family member having Parkinson’s for over 25 years, he has probably heard all of this before. Again even though he is not a doctor, he probably has paid close attention to what has been said to him.

Why do a lot of people who have Parkinson’s die of pneumonia? Well Tamburello answers that as well. “The reason is a lack of being able to control the ‘valve’ on your throat that prevents water from going into your lungs when drinking.”

Everyone has experienced this before. When you drink something and then suddenly start coughing and hacking, it is usually because you tried to take a breath at the same time that you were swallowing. Most people refer to this as “going down the wrong pipe.”

Tamburello continues on in his post. “This in a combination with the recent fondness of mumus, makes me think she is concealing a deep brain stim battery pack that counters her tremors from Parkinson’s (my dad has this battery pack too).”

Well that would explain why you never see Clinton shaking, if she does have this. After all that is one of the more noticeable symptoms of Parkinson’s disease is the shaking.

Tamburello finished his post by saying, “They may have admitted HRC has pneumonia, but that’s not WHY she has pneumonia. I believe she has pneumonia caused by Parkinson’s disease.”

He offers some evidence, and it could be a reasonable claim. However it appears that his Facebook post was removed. Why would it be removed? Well there are two basic options on why that would happen. The first reason is that it could be true and they don’t want people knowing, and the second reason is that Facebook is actively doing what it can to censor any and all anti-Clinton posts.

Facebook has a history of trying to censor right wing ideas. After all their trending news team was fired because of that specific reason.

Well there is more evidence for the first case. After Tamburello put his post on Facebook, people on Twitter started looking at the footage of Clinton’s collapse. And they started supporting his claim. Some of the users pointed out that her doctor did the “squeeze my fingers test.”

This specific test is a common way to determine neurological health. And furthermore, they use it to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. So all this evidence is going around that supports the claim that Clinton might have Parkinson’s disease.

Now naturally her personal doctor had released a statement that denied these claims. “Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies. On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule. While at this morning’s event, she became overheated and dehydrated. I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.”

Well of course her doctor is going to say that. But it still doesn’t answer why someone who was helping her was telling her to “squeeze my hand.” And considering that the “squeeze my fingers test” is a common way to diagnose the disease, people are going to become very suspicious.

People were already wondering about Clinton’s health since she had failed to tell everyone that she had pneumonia in the first place. This is only going to pester her some more until she actually releases her medical records.

Share this article to show that the democratic presidential nominee might actually have Parkinson’s disease. With all the evidence that someone who has seen and dealt with the disease for over 25 years, and considering that someone who was there told her to “squeeze my fingers,” which is a common neurological test, it isn’t completely out of the question to say that she has it.",Fake
84,"(Natural News) Donald Trump allegedly invited a homeless black woman to stay at Trump Tower after she was found squatting in the building. Although the story is still unconfirmed, this is just one of many instances where Trump has helped the less fortunate regardless of race or gender. The mainstream media are usually busy portraying Trump as a racist, bigot, or chauvinist. But Trump boasts a long and documented history of helping out — because it’s the right thing to do.

The homeless black woman reveals that, for eight years, she has been living in the Trump Tower for free. She says that she originally trespassed her way in before squatting in an empty room for the night. Police arrived the next day to address the situation. She was told she must leave the premises — or she would be subject to arrest.

“When I told them I would not go, they contacted Mr. Trump over the phone and he came down here. Instead of evicting me off the property, he said that I can stay and it’s been eight years I’ve been here,” she revealed. “Not only did he not evict me off the property, he made sure that I ate three meals a day by room service and that I get a delivery of fresh flowers every week.”

The woman goes on to express a great displeasure with the way the media portrays Trump as a bad person. She insists that if it weren’t for Trump’s generosity she would be homeless, in the streets, and most likely dead. The woman was never asked to pay a dime throughout the duration of her stay at the tower. “Donald Trump is not a bad guy, he’s a wonderful wonderful man, and everything I’m telling you today is true,” she concludes.

Trump treated his female employees very well

Trump’s female employees believe he is a champion of women as well as the less fortunate. Many of those who worked closely with trump say he was far ahead of his time for providing career advancement for women. Trump’s companies have promoted women in otherwise male-dominated industries, granting them entry into a new playing field.

Trump often told the female employees he worked with that he values women who can stand their ground in both legal battles, and on construction sites. Barbara Res was in charge of the Trump Tower’s 1980 construction. She recalls Trump telling the female employees that “men are better than women, but a good woman is better than 10 good men.”

85,"(Natural News) New EPA rules are being implemented on heavy trucks which has boosted the 10-year regulatory burden on America past the $1 trillion mark. 75 percent of that cost was imposed by the Obama administration. New analysis from American Action Forum shows that the cost amounts to an annual cost of $540 per person, or a one-time charge of $3,080.

“In other words, each year every person, regardless of age, in the nation is responsible for paying roughly $540 in regulatory costs. These burdens might take the form of higher prices, fewer jobs, or reduced wages,” said AAF’s Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the watchdog group.

President Obama is scrambling to lock in several new environmental regulations prior to leaving office. Obama has shattered the record for the amount of regulations and added red tape this year, and he still has time to impose many more before leaving office. The staggering amount of money he is costing America is likely to surge even higher. The implementation of new fuel standards for trucks resulted in the new high regulatory costs.

Batkins’ study dates back to 2005, when George W Bush held the oval office. He said that the Obama administration is responsible for about three-quarters of the added regulatory costs. “The Obama Administration surpassed 500 major regulations last summer, imposing $625 billion in cumulative costs. Earlier this year, regulators published the administration’s 600th major rule, increasing burdens to $743 billion. Now, thanks to data from the last term of the Bush Administration and another billion-dollar rule from EPA, the regulatory tally has surpassed $1 trillion. These figures are direct estimates from federal regulators, but it will take more than an effort from these regulators to amend hundreds of major regulations. Congress, the next president, and even the courts must participate in the next generation of regulatory modernization.”

The EPA wants to make it very difficult for the Trump administration to align fuel economy standards with the needs and expectations of Americans. EPA administrator Gina McCarthy has urged the agency’s employees to quickly finish as many rules as possible before Obama leaves the White House. The EPA reported last month that automakers exceeded fuel efficiency standards in new cars, but were unhappy with the agency’s early release of its fuel efficiency study.

Donald Trump has promised to kill more regulations then he will add while he is in office. Hopefully his administration will kill many of the regulatory burdens created by Obama.

87,"(NaturalNews) Corruption and ""pay-for-play"" scenarios involving powerful people and foreign governments that beat, imprison and kill gays is like an onion: Peel a layer and you find more.Now, as reported by, it appears as though the ""charity"" was less than charitable with the AIDS drugs it helped distribute to third-world countries battling the disease.Under a program begun by former President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, officials distributed ""watered-down"" HIV/AIDS drugs to sick patients in sub-Saharan Africa, which ""likely increased"" their risk of dying, according to a draft congressional reportobtained.Titled, ""The Clinton Foundation and the India Success Story,"" the congressional report was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who is vice chairperson of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to assist AIDS victims has been considered to be a fundamental force for good within the Clinton Foundation and is very probably the organization's most notable initiative.The congressional reported centered on Clinton's 10-plus-year relationship with a controversial India-based drug maker called Ranbaxy. CHAI used the company as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS medications to poor countries.The report also focused on the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a big-time whistleblower when he provided information to the U.S. government, which led to a landmark lawsuit against the Indian pharmaceutical company. Because the company also sold generic drugs in the United States, it was subject to U.S. regulations and prosecution for violations.Ultimately, in 2013 the company pleaded guilty to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and to introducing adulterated medications into interstate commerce. ""Adulterated"" is when a drug ""fails to conform to compendial standards of quality, strength or purity,"" according to the Food and Drug Administration In addition, the Department of Justice levied a fine against the company of $500 million, as well as forfeiture.As noted by, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Rod J. Rosenstein, said at the time of Ranbaxy's guilty plea the case represented ""the largest false claims case ever prosecuted"" in his district, as well as the ""nation's largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company.""""When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA's approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,"" added Stuart F. Delery, the acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Justice Department, after the U.S. government made its announcement regarding Ranbaxy's case.In its final settlement, the Department of Justice stated that, ""allegedly due to the company's diluted drugs, it 'subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,'"" the congressional report noted.In an interview with, Blackburn said the drugmaker's and foundation's actions produce some obvious questions, like, ""How many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise?""Revelations about CHAI potentially distributing adulterated AIDS drugs to Third World victims is likely to damage the Clinton Foundation's reputation even further, and may add another layer of corruption to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign . Sadly, unless her GOP opponent, Donald J. Trump , brings it up, the mainstream media won't be talking about it any time soon.As for Blackburn, she said she is planning to hand the report over to the inspector general's offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and the State Department, where Hillary Clinton served during President Obama's first term.In addition to findings of adulterated drug distribution, the report also shined a light on unseemly ties between Bill Clinton and a pair of highly controversial Indian-Americans who have fallen under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.Perhaps what is most problematic for the Clinton charity is its enthusiastic promotion of Ranbaxy, even though the Indian pharmaceutical giant persistently distributes poor-quality drugs, and covers for their faulty products with fraudulent reporting to the FDA.",Fake
88,"(Natural News) An absolute bombshell report was published Tuesday that refutes completely the discredited “mainstream media” and Democratic Party lie that Russia was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s email in the months leading up to the November election.

Fox News’ Malia Zimmerman writes that murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was in contact with whistleblower website WikiLeaks and turned over “thousands” of emails to the site pertaining to the corrupt inner workings of the organization:

The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, investigative sources told Fox News.

A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report — generated within 96 hours after DNC staffer Seth Rich’s murder — detailing the contents Rich’s computer said he made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.

The federal investigator told the news site: “I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks,” confirming that MacFadyen was genuine.

These claims are in line with details unearthed by Rod Wheeler, a former Washington Metropolitan Police homicide detective and contributor to Fox News. His private detective firm was hired by the Rich family to get to the bottom of his murder.

You may recall that Rich was shot very early in the morning walking home from a bar in D.C. He was very close to his home when he was gunned down. More intriguing is though D.C. police have labeled the murder a botched robbery, not a thing was stolen from Rich, though the shooter appeared to have plenty of time.

Also, as Fox News noted, D.C. Metro PD isn’t being cooperative; they won’t talk to the press and they won’t release video footage of the murder, which is standard procedure when cops are actually trying to find out whodunit.

The federal investigator said that Rich sent MacFadyen 44,053 emails which contained 17,761 attachments from January 2015 through May 2016.

Fox News noted further:

On July 22, just 12 days after Rich was killed, WikiLeaks published internal DNC emails that appeared to show top party officials conspired to stop Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont from becoming the party’s presidential nominee. That controversy resulted in Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigning as DNC chairperson. A number of Sanders supporters refused to back party nominee Hillary Clinton, and some subsequently formed groups to work against Clinton and the party.

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeatedly claimed that Russia was not the source of the documents. That claim was echoed by former Trump campaign chief Roger Stone just last week.

What’s more, as Natural News founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, reported in December, citing an exclusive from the UK’s Daily Mail, the DNC wasn’t hacked at all, but that documents provided to WikiLeaks were done the old-fashioned way – they were leaked – by someone upset at the way the DNC was treating Sanders:

After days of witnessing the left-wing media hyperventilate over completely fabricated claims that “the Russians” hacked the DNC emails and turned them over to Wikileaks, it turns out the emails were actually leaked by a DNC insider who was angry about the orchestrated elimination of Bernie Sanders by Clinton operatives.

The UK Daily Mail is now reporting that Craig Murray, the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, personally met the email leaker who handed him the emails files later released by Wikileaks. The email leaker, a Bernie Sanders insider, was reportedly motivated by “disgust at the corruption of the Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field against Bernie Sanders,” reports the Daily Mail.

The hand-off took place in Washington D.C. in a wooded area near American University, Murray explained.

“As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians,” writes Murray on his website. “As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks – there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened. The continued ability of the mainstream media to claim the leaks lost Clinton the election because of ‘Russia’, while still never acknowledging the truths the leaks reveal, is Kafkaesque.”

But still, the disgusting #NeverTrump Washington media has continued to echo the lie that the DNC was hacked, and this despite the fact that the organization refused to give the FBI permission to examine their email system in order to confirm it.

As we have said early and often, this entire “Russia-Trump-collusion-hacking-steal the election” narrative is a massive hoax committed against the American people by the Washington establishment and Deep State.

This latest report by Fox News – which, frankly, should be the No. 1 story of the day if not the entire election – proves that the Russians are being blamed for something Moscow did not do. (RELATED: Bombshell: Murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich leaked ‘thousands of emails’ to WikiLeaks)

This isn’t to say that the Kremlin has not attempted to interfere in U.S. elections; Russia’s been trying to do that since the days of the Cold War (and vice versa for the United States). But to blame them for something that they obviously did not do is irresponsible and conspiratorial.

Democrats and Deep State operatives have been claiming that Russia was trying to undermine confidence in our electoral system. The truth is, the Democratic Party is trying to do that.

People should be going to jail for this.

The Russians are employing the exact same tactics that we witnessed in Syria and during the two Chechen wars, but the mainstream media doesn’t seem to understand this. Up to this point, the mainstream media has used the fact that many major Ukrainian cities have not yet fallen as evidence that the war is not going too well for Russia. But the truth is that the Russians did not intend to recklessly send their forces into dense urban areas immediately. That is something that western military leaders do way too often, and it is a way to get thousands of troops needlessly gunned down. Instead, the Russians are encircling the largest Ukrainian cities. A perimeter is established which cuts off all food and supplies, and then the circle is slowly but surely squeezed tighter as the “cauldron” is relentlessly pummeled by Russian firepower.

93,"Trump Vows To Protect The US From All Foreign Undocumented Hurricanes

With the impending threat of Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean, US President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance against tropical storms travelling from south of the border.

He used a press conference today to condemn foreign hurricanes travelling to the US.

“These hurricanes are a drain to the American taxpayer and they can expect the authorities to keep a very close eye on them.”

“When these hurricanes get here, they’re not sending their best. They’re bringing floods, they’re bringing rain, they’re rapists.”

Hurricane Irma has been classified as the worst storm in Atlantic history, or as climate change deniers call it: “bad luck”.

Meanwhile, the President visited areas affected by Hurricane Harvey, taking a break from his tweet schedule. Both have caused mass damage across the US.

“I read this morning that they’ve had a bumper spaghetti harvest in Italy this year. That’s true. And another article here says that Big Ben is getting a digital clock. That’s true too – I’ve seen it myself. So good”.

He said it was about time news outlets put forward the facts. “It’s taken them until the first day of April to do it, but the media is finally reporting real news. Now, I’m off to get a fry-flavoured thick shake from Burger King”.

95,"Trump’s First 100 Days Have Had Way More Days Than Obama’s First 100 Days, White House Says

White House spokesperson Sean Spicer says Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office contained the largest number of days ever seen in a President’s first 100 days, period.

In a fiery press conference in the capital, Spicer hit out at critics who claimed Mr Trump’s first 100 days consisted of only 100 days. “There have been literally thousands of days. Tens of thousands perhaps. These attempts to try and minimise the enormous number of days we’ve seen so far is just shameful and wrong,” he said.

Experts have pointed out that Trump’s first 100 days contained exactly the same number of days as Obama’s first 100 days. But Mr Trump labelled those reports as fake news. “Don’t believe what the failing New York Times or the lying CNN tells you. We’ve achieved more days – so many more days – than Obama did in the same time frame. It’s been so tremendous,” he said. “The days have been bigger too. The longest days we’ve seen”.

The next 100 days are expected to be even longer.

96,"In a poignant moment on his Middle East visit, US President Donald Trump took time out to hide his tax returns from the last twenty years in Jerusalem’s holy Western Wall.

While some believed he was filing a building application to have the site demolished and replaced with a Trump Hotel, insiders believe it was actually documents from Inland Revenue proving he had paid no tax.

Mr Trump placed the folded up pieces of paper into a crack in the wall, before saying a short prayer to himself.

Asked about the moment later, Trump said it was a private moment between him and his wall.

97,"War on Drugs: Trump Agrees To Put His Name On Ecstasy Tablets To Ensure Its Business Model Fails

As part of the US Government’s ongoing War on Drugs, US President Donald Trump has generously agreed to lend his name and image to ecstasy tablets to make absolutely certain the associated businesses fail.

It follows similar strategies in the steak, water and university industries.

Analysts say businesses are seven times more likely to go bankrupt once Trump puts his name to them, and have applauded the President’s gesture of lending his name to help stamp out the illicit trade.

“He has a habit of taking flourishing businesses, putting his name on the packaging, and then watching them fail. That’s exactly what we’d like to see with drugs,” a DEA spokesperson said.

Mr Trump has also been asked to launch a pharmaceutical brand, to help end the country’s battle with prescription opioids.

98,"Fresh off his gaffe involving President Andrew Jackson and the Civil War, Donald Trump has made yet another historical faux pas regarding the “War of Northern Aggression.” In an interview with The Red Shtick, Trump regaled us with his other thoughts on the war that an angry Jackson totally saw coming.

Trump has been struggling to defend his comments — widely deemed preposterous, even by St. Landry Parish educational standards — in which he claimed a man who owned as many as 300 slaves would’ve found a way to prevent the Civil War.

The Donald, a member of the Party of Lincoln, elaborated on his recent controversial remarks about how the first Democratic U.S. president, who died 16 years before the Civil War, would have managed to avoid a war the first Republican president could not.

Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.

Speaking to our intern Dave Robicheaux, who is paid in Facebook likes, Trump insisted Col. Harland Sanders, whom he called a “tremendous Civil War hero,” once saved an entire army at Valley Forge from certain starvation. Trump, a noted fan of Kentucky Fried Chicken, explained how Col. Sanders took five loaves of Evangeline Maid bread and two chickens, added his secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, and turned these humble ingredients into delicious meals that lasted an entire winter.

Robicheaux attempted to explain to Trump that Col. Sanders was born 25 years after the end of the war, that The Donald seemed to be confusing the food incident with a Biblical story about Jesus feeding the multitudes, and that Valley Forge was neither an encampment nor a battle site during the Civil War.

Upon being confronted with these facts, The Donald abruptly ended his interview with us, and he was last seen headed for a Confederate monument removal protest in New Orleans while screaming about fake news.

Church’s Chicken and Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen were unavailable for comment.

Incidentally, Trump has promised to deport every worker at those two companies’ restaurants if they don’t share their respective secret recipes with him.

I just saw my visionary infrastructure plan that would create jobs for millions of Americans like a week ago—maybe it’s in the car? Couldn’t hurt to look there at this point.” At press time, Kushner was still unable to locate his notes for dissuading his father-in-law from taking such a soft stance toward neo-Nazism but ultimately decided he wasn’t too excited about that project anyway.",Satire
100,"WASHINGTON—Saying they wished to pay tribute to the legacies of these distinguished, law-abiding Americans, the Trump administration announced Friday that a long anticipated redesign of the $20 bill would honor Harriet Tubman’s owners. “These were patriotic business proprietors who followed the laws of their time to further their economic interests, and this new currency design finally recognizes these enterprising individuals for their success,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at an afternoon press conference, explaining that the bills commemorating those responsible for enslaving the famed abolitionist, Civil War nurse, and women’s rights activist for the first three decades of her life would be in circulation by 2018. “For too long, we’ve overlooked the achievements of these upstanding citizens and prosperous agriculturalists. The new $20 note, which will feature a portrait of the Brodess family on the front and a depiction of the Maryland plantation they operated on the back, will at last give them their proper place in American history.” Mnuchin then sought to assuage any concerns about the decision, assuring those in attendance that the Trump White House was already looking into ways to preserve Andrew Jackson’s likeness by having it replace Abraham Lincoln on the $5 bill.",Satire

103,"WASHINGTON DC – Months after Trump’s “Muslim ban”, prohibiting the travel from a list of middle eastern and African countries that pose a threat to the U.S, It is being reported that Trump is also pushing towards a “Taco ban”.

Trump’s hatred for illegal immigrants is no secret, specifically Mexicans. Promising to soon have a wall built on the US/Mexico border to keep illegals out. But nobody ever thought Trump’s hatred for Mexicans to ever reach these heights. However, a “Taco ban” wouldn’t be an accurate term for the proposed ban, as Trump is pushing to have most mexican dishes and products to be banned from America, which includes: tacos, tortas, tostadas, quesadillas, horchata, etc. However, according to Trump’s team, tequila is still being intensely debated.



Although later admitting that he is somewhat a fan of the elote man, Trump told the press: “We have to get rid of all the Mexican food. If we want to make America great again, we have to earn the respect we once had. Mexico takes us as a joke because they know we[Americans] love Mexican food, and think we can’t live without Mexican culture, but it’s my job as the president to show them we can, we have to make America great again. We want nothing to do with Mexico. If all the Mexican food is gone, Mexicans will start leaving as well”.

Although many Trump supporters are most likely slowly becoming aware that their president is indeed suffering from some sort of yet to be diagnosed mental disorder, experts believe they will still continue to agree and follow with any of his actions. After recently failing to repeal and replace Obamacare, experts believe Trump felt he had to ban something to feel he was in control again, thus leading to the Taco Ban proposal.

According to Trump, he will issue an executive order for the “Taco ban” in April, as he also did with the Muslim Ban. Stay tuned for updates on the “taco ban” and President Trump.

WASHINGTON DC – The violence in Chicago is no joke, the midwest city has among the highest murder rates in the country, with more homicides in 2016 than New York City and Los Angeles combined, there seems to be no end to the carnage. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has been constantly pushed to take action and help Chicago officials to stop the violence. President Trump has now unveiled his plan to end Chicago’s murder epidemic, and its a very intriguing one.

What’s the plan? A newly released statement by President Trump reveals an unorthodox proposal—a batman-like vigilante. “It’s obvious that Mr. Rahm Emanuel and the CPD aren’t doing a thing to stop their city from becoming a war zone, so we are sending in someone who will, and by that we mean one specially trained individual to take matters into his own hands, and accordingly”, finished Trump. Further details show that Trump and his team, in accordance with the Central Intelligence Agency, have employed a highly trained individual, an expert detective, strategist, spy, hand-to-hand combat, and specializing in the utilization of high-tech equipment, gear, and weapons, to serve as a vigilante in the crime-infested streets of Chicago—a “Batman”, if you will.

The vigilante, code-named ‘REAPER’, will remain anonymous and will operate alone, separate from Chicago’s police department and has been granted special permission from the president to take any action that is deemed necessary to stop the street crime, which includes extortion and even murder without prosecution from Chicago’s judicial system.

REAPER is scheduled to be deployed into the city of chicago sometime during the summer.

107,"Spicer: “Trump Led BREXIT Successfully Because Of His Upper-Class, Eloquent English Skills”

During Wednesday’s press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a strange response when European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker criticized President Donald Trump’s comprehension of world affairs. Last week, Junker warned that more countries may leave the European Union after Trump’s administration applauded Britain’s departure from the EU. “I think the president is very well steeped in world affairs, especially Europe, NATO, all of the issues,” Spicer insisted. “He was a leader in the effort to call BREXIT, as you know.”

Asked to comment on whether there was any connection between President Trump’s position on BREXIT and the fact that the majority of Britain’s citizens voted for leaving the EU, Spicer argued that the British were “smitten” with the billionaire businessman-turned-president’s language skills, and decided to hear him out. “As we all know, President Trump and citizens of the UK haven’t really gotten off on the right foot, so to speak. I think we all remember that, at one point, there was even a petition floating around to ban Donald Trump from entering Great Britain,” Spicer reminded members of the press.

“However, if you were to ask the British today how they felt about our president, I believe you would encounter very different responses,” he continued. “In my personal opinion, it is my belief that the British people became so smitten with the fact that Donald Trump at one point spoke upper-class, eloquent English that they realized he was an okay person. To make matters even more obvious, President Trump is, after all, of Scottish heritage on his mother’s side. So, there’s also that. Now, I’m well aware of the fact that the English and the Scottish don’t always see eye to eye despite being in the same union, but it would seem they have managed to find common ground when it comes to President Donald Trump.”

Asked to elaborate further on Trump’s rumored “eloquent” language skills, the press secretary argued that, even though Trump’s language was a much-disputed point during his campaign, “Donald Trump is known as an extremely hard worker and self-made billionaire.” He also said, “That’s why it comes as no surprise that he was able to improve his language to the point where he became a favorite of the citizens of the country in which our language first originated. And to put that in perspective, we’re talking here about England, which as you all know, has pretty much nothing left to show for other than it’s complicated language rules and extremely broad dictionary.”

“At the end of the day, I’m not going to say that the English voted to leave the EU because Donald Trump said it would be a good idea. However, I would like to believe that deep down, they listened to him and really heard what he was saying precisely because he was speaking very nice in their language. When you compare that to the situation in which they’re debating whether or not they’re going to let him into the country, I think that’s equivalent to climbing Mount Everest in a matter of minutes. It was a huge undertaking. And by the way, the fact that Mount Everest’s summit is just as cold as the British are towards Americans makes it all the more sweeter for him, I would imagine,” Spicer concluded.",Satire
108,"RICHMOND, Va. – Senior officials at the Ukrop’s Flight Facility have announced plans to launch a weather satellite, model RAINBOW-4248CO, this weekend at the Bob Ukrop Space Center in Goochland County, VA.

While the satellite was described as merely meteorological, the launch has been met with outrage from Kroger, a long-standing rival of Ukrop’s Super Markets and Homestyle Foods. Top officials quickly responded with a statement condemning the launch and calling for an international response to Ukrop’s’ space program.

“We’ve seen this kind of aggressive behavior from Ukrop’s before,” commented Kroger Bakery Defense Minister Col. William T. McPearson. “Those bastards have been trying to steal our recipes for decades. We’re not falling for it and we promise you, we will respond.”

Tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years after Ukrop’s was purchased by competitor Martin’s Food Markets. Both Martin’s and Kroger carry Ukrop’s’ line of baked goods, though this is mostly seen as a form of grocery appeasement in response to increasingly belligerent posturing by the defunct local store.

“Our Rainbow Cookie satellite is purely for measuring climatic phenomena,” responded Mason Detweiler, the Chief Space Commissioner for Ukrop’s. “We’re a peaceful bakery looking to study clouds, nothing more.”

There is speculation among the League of Grocers that the Ukrop’s satellite will instead be laden with advanced surveillance technology. “Listen, we’ve looked into sanctions, we’ve looked into baked intervention,” commented Dr. Nancy Fitzgerald, acting Chairwoman of the Ukrop’s watchdog group BakeWatch. “At the end of the day, Ukrop’s is a sovereign company that bakes delicious, fluffy rolls, but if they violate the Cakes & Cookies Agreement of ‘82 we’ll be watching and we’ll take action.”

Many see the launch as a last-ditch attempt at glory for a once super market. Many in the baking community are hoping for a speedy de-escalation of the Ukrop’s/Kroger tensions. “We’ve lost a lot of good cakes over the years,” added Col. McPearson, “We’re ready for peace. But we’re also ready for war.”",Satire

Tom Wallace, a Nelson County native, thought he had met his match this past weekend when he suddenly found himself surrounded by an uncontrollable fire. Wallace, however, wasn’t going let his hillside home turn into ashes. “My ol’ hickory moonshine can cure damn near anything,” Wallace commented. “I happened to be mid-swig of some of my Virginia lightning when all of a sudden I done smelt some smoke near the garage. My first thought was ‘Damnit, did I leave the grill on again?’ but before I knew it I was face to face with the devil’s hellfire.” Wallace, who was nowhere near any source of water, resorted to spitting his moonshine onto the fire in an effort to subdue it. “I ain’t about to let no fire take my house away,” slurred Wallace, who managed to walk away from the disaster with only minor burns. However, despite his best efforts, Wallace’s house was eventually fully engulfed by the flames when he hurled the rest of his bottle at the fire in a fit of callous rage.

110,"RICHMOND, Va. — The League of the South, a neo-Confederate group, has commissioned a series of Snapchat filters in an attempt to connect with potential Millennial and Generation Z converts. These location-specific imaging filters, or “geofilters,” can be used at well-known Confederate landmarks throughout the South.

RELATED (article continued below):

Ballenger Motorsports has been providing PPE gear (at cost) to first responders, hospitals, and the general public throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Learn more about their project here.

One of the most popular filters can be found at Richmond’s own Robert E. Lee statue on Monument Avenue. Here visitors can be turned into General Lee and placed in front of a Confederate flag background. In addition to the full beard and dandy comb-over, the filter also provides a voice-changer, altering the user’s voice to a deep southern drawl with just a tinge of genteel racism.

Snapchat produces imaging filters that can accommodate more than one individual, often applying a different effect to the less prominent face in the photo. In the case of the Robert E. Lee filter, the secondary subject dons a virtual Confederate infantry uniform, complete with a layer of lice bites and dysentery-induced sweating.

Adolf McCreary, a member of the League of the South, traveled all the way from Winchester to take a picture in front of the infamous statue.

“Those libtard pussies are denying their southern heritage. We’re giving everyone the chance to feel like a true American hero,” McCreary explained. “The South with rise again. Virtually, that is.”

City spokesperson Laura Smithson released a statement regarding the controversial Snapchat filter: “The City of Richmond wants it clear that it does not condone the use of these divisive Snapchat filters. Richmond is committed to keeping an environment that is welcoming and safe for people of all races and creeds. We absolutely do not support any attempt to divide or alienate the people of this great city.”

In response to the news that there has been an increase in the number of “alt-right” individuals having their asses kicked as a result of using the Lee Snapchat filter, Smithson responded in a monotone, “Oh no. Gosh, that’s terrible. Geez. Stop. Please. No.”

In an attempt to draw attention away from the League of the South’s social media ploy, the City of Richmond has decided to release its own youth-appealing Snapchat filters. A few blocks down from the Lee statue at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Roseneath Road, Snapchat users can superimpose their face on the animated, tennis racket-swinging body of Arthur Ashe surrounded by a crowd of cowering Bitmoji children.",Satire

The announcement was met with praise by the council which has been seen as weak on Hanover following its annexation of King William county. The severe sanctions will put pressure on Hanover’s delicious berry and haunted hayride industry and are aimed at curbing the county’s aggressive posturing in recent months. “We categorically deny any such lies and will continue to act as an independent county free of any Russian ties,” commented Hanover mayor Kenneth Mathews, “My hunting trips with my friend Vladimir are part of any healthy personal friendship.”

112,"WASHINGTON — In a move that threatened to upset weeks of strenuous deliberation, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., submitted a bold resolution to the floor asking that the debt ceiling be raised. While Kaine’s resolution asked for an increase of a mere $2, it noted that these additional funds would be specifically allocated for the purchase of a single Virginia Lottery scratch card.

The senator insisted that this resolution, if passed, could pay out big dividends.

“I cannot tell you how many times in my youth I had my back to the wall, wondering where my next big break would come from and got pulled out of the fire by a scratcher,” Kaine explained. “If we lose, we only lose two bucks, but if we win, oh boy, then we win big,” the senator concluded as he clutched the sides of the podium with white knuckles.

He went on to assure the Senate body that his plan represented a far less risky strategy than the other proposed resolutions and stated that “investing and stuff is hard and confusing.”

As they argued against the resolution, many senators pointed out that they had recently noticed an abundance of crumpled scratchers cluttering Kaine’s desk in the Senate Chamber.

AUGUSTA, Maine –

Maine has been in the news all year for legalizing marijuana for recreational use, and apparently legalizing weed was only the beginning. Following on the heels of the wave of marijuana legalization, some might be surprised to hear that Maine state legislature has decided to legalize the popular street drug Ecstasy. Recreational use of will become fully legal in the state by the end of this year.

The decision was met with controversy but “no more or less than the original decision to legalize marijuana,” Governor Paul LePage stated.

The state is still working out some guidelines and ground rules for suppliers, such as purity levels, permits, and health code requirements. While LePage says the vote was popular among a lot of people in the state, his decision came as a shock for many Mainers. Governor LePage did not comment on whether or not he partakes in the drug himself.

“By legalizing, monitoring, and taxing ecstasy, we will not only cut down on inmates and care costs, it will also open up a whole new job market,” LePage explains. “It’s a good situation all around, especially for taxpayers.”

Some of the most outspoken opponents, however, have been current drug dealers.

“Making it legal is a terrible idea,” a dealer, who chose to remain anonymous, told Empire News. “We don’t want regulated. We’re killing it stacking paper right now, but regular guys like me won’t be able to keep up with all the government regulations. This is gonna put me out of a job!”

Despite the negative press, experts estimate this legalization will drop the state’s debt by as much as 50% in the first year. This may translate into tax cuts, more public projects, better road maintenance, and possibly even government rehabilitation programs for more dangerous drugs like cigarettes.

“If they want people to not buy drugs legally, then for crying out loud they should shut down every Starbucks in the United States,”said LePage. “Marijuana, ecstasy, crack…hell, what’s the difference? The revenue the state will bring in, it’s astronomical. Health is one thing, but we’re talking about money here.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Trump announced late last night that congress voted 322 to 105 in favor of dismantling the statue of liberty, due to its “misleading statements” engraved on the pedestal.

The statue reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!” According to Americans Against Illegal Immigration, along with our Republican Congress and Donald Trump, this statement misleads immigrants from other countries. It may have them believing they are welcome into America at any time.

“We do not want to allow the tired, poor and homeless into this country. We have enough of those already,” said President Trump. “If they’re tired, poor, and homeless in their own country, what makes you think they’ll do any better over here?Guarantee you they will go on welfare and rob people to survive. That’s what they do. I cannot Make America Great Again if we’re always feeding the hungry from other countries.”

The dismantling of the Statue of Liberty is set to begin March 1, 2018. It is estimated it will take two months to dismantle, then released for shipment back to France by the end of next year. The Statue of Liberty has been seated on Liberty Island in the middle of New York Harbor since October 28, 1886.

The New York historical Museum has already vowed to occupy the area around the historic site for a “sit in” type protest where they will handcuff one another to form a complete circle around the base of the statue.

“They cannot tear it down if we form an unbreakable human barrier,” said José Ramirez, president of the Immigrant Resource Center of New York. “As Patrick Henry said, ‘Give me liberty, or give me death!’ We are not backing down.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

In a move that nearly everyone called “totally retarded,” President Trump stood out on the White House balcony during the solar eclipse, and stared directly into the sun. White House physician, Dr. Mark Campbell, now reports that Donald Trump has lost nearly 50% of his vision in one eye.

“President Trump was warned that staring at the sun could cause serious damage, but he assumed it was fake news,” said Dr. Campbell. “Since the eclipse, Trump’s vision has become worse and worse, with a noticeable deterioration of his retina. There is no reversing it.”

Dr. Campbell went on to say that Trump’s left eye experienced some damage as well, but that the right eye sustained the brunt of the damage.

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

President Donald Trump has admitted that the real reason he banned transgenders in the military is because he has begun his transition into a woman, and said he was “scared” he might have to serve in the military.

“I already dodged the draft, made my way through life without ever having to serve in the military, so there was no way I was going to ever have to deal with possibly engaging in real combat,” said President Trump. “It worked out that I was planning on becoming a woman, as I’ve known for some time that I was not comfortable as a man. I mean, I’m not a faggy peter-puffer or anything. I still love grabbing women by the pussy. I just like to tuck it back and throw on a nice dress.”

When he was informed that he is well past the age of being drafted in the likely case that he leads the country into war, Trump was noticeably embarrassed.

“Nobody tells me anything about how this stuff actually works,” said our Commander-in-Chief. “Either way, I cannot wait for everyone to meet the new Donald. I think I’m going to go with the name Donna.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. –

Senator John McCain shocked the entire country by voting NO on the Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor the other day, but even though he made a wave of new fans from the left, he is now saying he made a mistake, and that his brain tumor is to brain.

“I momentarily lost my senses, and literally couldn’t remember which way was up, and which was down,” said McCain, speaking from his home, where doctors have put him on bedrest. “I meant, of course, to vote TO repeal it, as was the plan. As I’ve mentioned before. There’s nothing that Republicans like doing more than screwing the entire country, and so naturally I should have given a thumbs-up. I swear I did. This brain tumor is really taking its toll.”

Unfortunately, the vote sticks as-is, unless a majority calls for a new vote sometime in the next 90 days.

“I think at that vote, I may abstain,” said McCain. “If I’m still alive, I really don’t want to mess this up again, and you never know how my vote might go.”

119,"After the president Unpresidentially resorted to rhetoric usually ascribed to lunatic dictators in response to North Korea's typical ""give me money"" antics, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided that preventative measures needed to be taken.

Newly minted Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis wasted no time corralling the often unbridled Commander in Chief. ""Since, the President is unaccustomed to the fine art of diplomacy we have taken the necessary steps to make sure he doesn't accidentally write a check that America's butt doesn't really want to cash.""

The Secretary was believed to be referring to the new White House policy of hiding the nuclear codes inside a book. The thought being, there is a 0% the president will ever open a book, even if he feels like nuking somebody.

General Joe Dunford explained, ""We originally were going to hide it in the President's own Bible, but then we realized he might start waving it around when his conservative base starts to figure out the last time the President was in church he was in diapers, and we don't mean depends.""

It was determined that the safest book to hide it in was War and Peace, because, ""it was big enough that there was no chance Trump would risk picking it up to show how tiny his fingers are, much less consider reading the thing.""

Deputy Secretary of Defense, Pat Shanahan explained that they also took measures to remove all markers from the Oval Office to prevent the president from writing the codes on his hand. ""It was a bit of a habit he was getting into,"" the Deputy Secretary explained. ""It usually worked itself out, since he wipes his mouth with his hands after lunch, and the grease from the fried chicken usually smeared a few of the characters so he couldn't read it. Our concern then became, what if he requested the codes during one of his 3:00 a.m. tweet storms, and decided to fire off a few weapons before breakfast?""

The nuclear suitcase that is always at the president's disposal was also addressed. ""We just put baby locks on it,"" Mattis explained. ""Through direct experience with the President we have observed that if anything takes him more than two minutes to figure out he usually loses interest in. It's kind of like dealing with an orangutan."" Secretary Mattis reaffirmed his confidence that there was no way that Trump could figure out baby locks within that narrow of a time frame, even with his ""baby-sized fingers.""

""Listen, the President has the same freedom of speech as every other American, so he can talk all the fire and whatever the hell else he wants. We just want to make sure that when he sounds off like a total tool bag he doesn't accidentally start World War 3.""",Satire

123,"This may be a bit controversial, but I’ve been looking into the Christian monarchist movement recently, and I’m starting to think we can make a compelling case from Scripture as to why we should have a King. And I’m not talking about the US joining the British Commonwealth ( Deuteronomy 17:15 ) or becoming a constitutional monarchy , but an absolute monarchy.

A representative republic is not Biblical

In fact, it is never mentioned in the Bible. There was a time when God’s people had no King, but the anarchy under the judges was not a good thing.

Judges 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.

And democratically electing leaders may not be the best way to go. Shouldn’t we let God choose our leader?

Hosea 8:4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.

The Bible commands us to honor the King

Which is difficult to do if you don’t have one.

Ecclesiastes 8:2 I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.

Ecclesiastes 8:3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

Ecclesiastes 8:4 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

Ecclesiastes 8:5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.

Proverbs 24:21 My son, fear thou the Lord and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:

Proverbs 24:22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?

First Peter 2:13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme ;

First Peter 2:14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

First Peter 2:15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:

First Peter 2:16 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

First Peter 2:17 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king .

The advantages of a monarchy

Kings are always right.

Proverbs 16:10 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.

Proverbs 8:15 By [wisdom] kings reign, and princes decree justice.

But even if they aren’t, we should still obey them. We could look at how David refused to harm Saul even when he was trying to kill him.

First Samuel 24:6 And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord’s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.

Or we could look at how Jesus told the Jews to obey the Roman Emperor.

Mark 12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.

We could also look at the books of Samuel. They’re a bit confusing to read. It’s almost as if Samuel couldn’t make up his mind whether having a King was a good idea or a bad one. For example, here’s one passage that makes it sound as if God’s people had rejected Him by wanting a King to rule over them instead of a prophet.

First Samuel 8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.

First Samuel 8:7 And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

But then as we read on, we see how having a King enabled God’s people to unite and defeat their enemies. The country seems to be divided at the moment and it has so many enemies — North Korea, Mexicans, Muslims.



Could Trump be another King David and deliver God’s people from their enemies?

Having a King would also help us to set up a Theocracy. The King is required to write a copy of God’s law for himself and read it every day (Deuteronomy 17:18-20). A good King could be a religious reformer like Josiah (Second Chronicles 34:1-35:27).

How can monarchies be bad if Jesus is a King?

We’re soon going to be living under one when Jesus comes back, if you accept a literal reading of the Bible. He will rule as King on earth from Jerusalem for 1,000 years and then for ever on the New Earth from the New Jerusalem.

Matthew 25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory .

Psalm 48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King .

Micah 4:7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.

Revelation 19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself . . .

Revelation 19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

Revelation 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings , And Lord Of Lords.

Revelation 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years .

Hebrews 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.

Can we really come up with a better system of government than God?

Do we now have a suitable candidate?

Ok, so Trump has had three wives. That’s nothing compared to Solomon (First Kings 11:3)

I think it would be nice if we could lock in Trump. I don’t want to think about getting stuck with a Democrat if they one day actually suspend democratic elections, like they always secretly want to do.

So, what do you think?",Satire
124,"

Glory to Jesus ! President Trump has once again approached the sinners with a tremendous message. Praise God ! It’s the now famous “covfefe” message that fools (Proverbs 10:21) fail to understand. President Trump , as always, knows what He is doing. The explanations by the biased liberal press are revealing but useless. Quote: It’s a good guess that the word he was looking for was “ coverage .” But the tweet, and the thought, remained incomplete. Within two hours, it had been retweeted more than 60,000 times and “liked” more than 74,000 times — making it one of his most popular tweets in months. Our True Christian™ Department of Biblical Linguistics at the Landover Baptist University (Lamentations Flint Memorial Building) do acknowledge that the sentence would make secular sense with the word “coverage” as follows: “Despite the constant negative press coverage”. But that is old alternative news. President Trump has moved beyond the mortal realm of mundane worries. We were certain that the message would contain a Biblical message and after careful scrutiny we are happy to announce that is does!

Covfefe -> cov fe fe -> parts of words -> three words involved -> it’s time to look at the King James Bible ! -> parts of->words involved -> it’s time to look at the Cov -> Covenant! Hebrews 8:6

But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises. The Covenant between God and His True Christian™ flock, but also a better Covenant, the Covenant of President Trump with His chosen people, again, us True Christians™! Glory. Fe -> Life! Matthew 25:46

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. The Covenant is here. The negative press shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous True Christians™ (i.e., us) into Life Eternal. Glory. Fe -> Female! Genesis 1:27

So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

The Covenant gives us Life Eternal if we follow the Creation Doctrine of God and refrain from gender confusion and sodomy! Now the message of President Trump can be translated to the masses. “Despite the Constant Negative Press Covfefe“ -> Despite the Constant Negative Press, the Covenant Remains and is Stronger because of My Ministry (i.e., Presidency). It will take you True Christians™ into Life Eternal if you follow the God-given roles of Male and Female. A staggering message from a Terrific President directed at us. Let us all join in a Prayer of Thanks!



Thank you, Jesus for giving us President Trump! Yours in Christ, Elmer

125,"Jesus felt He needed to post the following verse on two separate Gospels so it must be True™:

Mark 10:25

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.

Luke 18:25

For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.



It is True™ and it is being abused in a disgusting manner by atheist secularist of the sodomite agenda to accuse our President Trump for acting in an un-Christian manner. Just because He is rich!

As True Christians™ it is our task to defend the Godliest President ever, Mr. Donald Trump, from this contemptuous and erroneous slander. The ridiculous claim of these false Christians is that as President Trump is rich, He cannot get into Heaven. However, the apparent contradiction is not contradictory at all when we look at the alternative explanations provided by the best available evidence in order of importance:

1. The Bible.

2. Powerful personal Testimonials.

3. Observational data (photographs, research data, etc.).

Is the verse about camels and needles a True™ one? Of course it is. However, there is the question of translations. An ancient translation into the Syriack or Aramaic (Daniel 2:4) tongue called the Peshitta (Luke 18:25ܕܠܝܠܐ ܗܝ ܠܓܡܠܐ ܕܒܚܪܘܪܐ ܕܡܚܛܐ ܢܥܘܠ ܐܘ ܥܬܝܪܐ ܠܡܠܟܘܬܗ ܕܐܠܗܐ) may offer an explanation.

Quote: …Peshitta translation [which] has the word ‘rope’ in the main text but a footnote on Matthew 19:24 which states that the Aramaic word gamla means rope and camel , possibly because the ropes were made from camel hair.

This would mean that it is actually a rope that should be but through the eye of a needle, which is at first glance much easier than it is to accomplish the feat with a camel. However, we must abandon this stupid claim, as God would not have allowed mistakes in the King James Version. So, a “camel” it is.

Next, is it really that hard to put a camel through the needle’s eye? We acknowledge that it is hard but not impossible. There are many parameters of the equation that can be modified: the size of the camel and the size of the needle, the liquefaction of the camel or its vaporization to ease its passage, and the possible topological transformation of a camel. Please find below some visual aids to help you understand these possibilities.

None of these alternatives is easy, but basically, Jesus never mentioned it would be impossible for a rich man to enter Heaven, just difficult. Is President Trump up to that challenge? Verily, He is!

Quote: Originally uttered by Donald Trump Is there a brick wall getting in your way? Fine. That happens. But you have a choice. You can walk away from the wall. You can go over the wall. You can go under the wall. You can go around the wall. You can also obliterate the wall. In other words, don’t let anything get in your way. Get a balance, and then let the positive outdistance the negative.

Don’t let anything get in your way! Obliterate the stupid Walls! President Trump loves a challenge and He always wins. Even if there was a wall hard to permeate made of precious stones (Revelation 21:19), President Trump would still get through.



Proverbs 24:16

For a just [man] falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.

Now we must assess if President Trump is actually rich in the manner that Jesus mentions in those wonderful verses. Actually, He isn’t. The life story of President Trump is one of from rags to riches. He started off extremely poor and desperate with no actual help from His parents.





Furthermore, all of the riches gathered by President Trump have been pivotal in order to get Him into the White House. The master plan of Jesus Christ to have Trump channel God’s Will unto America could not have been possible without billions of dollars. Now all this is being used for the benefit of the American voter. Praise Jesus!

Finally, it is time to assess the Spiritual State of President Trump. Above, we saw observational data and it all supported the fact that The Donald will one day sit on Jesus’s lap in Heaven. How about testimonial data? What can we learn from there?

Trump has promised to rule with Christ!

He loves the Bible!

He’s a great Christian, a True Christian™. This means that no matter what sins He might have committed before being born again in Christ, it is all forgotten now, and Luke 18:25 no longer holds Him!



2 Corinthians 5:17

Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

These are powerful Testimonials by a man of God and they all agree: President Trump tells us that He is Spiritually mature and ready to meet Jesus in Heaven. Because of what He Himself says, He is.

What about the Bible? What does it tell us? It tells us that Jesus Himself ordained President Trump to take His Godly office.



Romans 13:1

Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

As we can see, the atheist agenda of false accusations fails miserably. President Trump’s abode in Heaven is secure. This was all just wanton persecution by those who align themselves with Satan!

Perhaps this hard-working man will finally find peace and quiet in Heaven and be able to concentrate on perfecting His swinging.

Yours in Christ,

Elmer

126,"Glory! Our President Mr. Donald Trump , the Best Friend of Jesus and President Putin , has released His plans to rectify and cure the Nation’s Economy. Of course, no True Christian™ would ever doubt His goodwill and Spiritual Purity when it comes to economics, but it is still worthwhile to scrutinize His Budget against the Truth™ and nothing but the Truth™, the Bible . As we examine the main points of Trump’s Budget we shall realize that He must have consulted the Will of Jesus Christ as transmitted in the Holy Bible when He was preparing this document that will remain to serve as a lesson for the infinite future.

First, the Departments with increased funds.

Department of Defense: $574 billion, +10%

Highly Biblical: The Last Days are a-comin’ and we must be prepared!

Joel 3:10 – Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. [Do not forget Joel 2:20 as it might predict a Canuck invasion and with this real threat we must be vigilant!]

Luke 22:36 – Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.

Department of Homeland Security: $44.1 billion, +6.7%

Highly Biblical: Self-Defence is the Way of Christ!

Romans 13:4 – For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

Exodus 22:2-3 – If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, [there shall] no blood [be shed] for him.

Department of Veterans Affairs: $78.9 billion, +5.9%

Highly Biblical: Any Soldier doing the Will of Trump is doing the Will of Jesus!

Joshua 1:9 – Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.

John 15:13 – Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

Now, before we move on to budget cuts, we must assess our disappointment about the data above. Why are the increases so tiny? These small increases are worth only of $52 billion! Why not much more? Here we must understand that this is only the first year of the Presidency. We’ll get there eventually, and this is a good start. Let us support President Trump despite the slight disappointment. Now we can move on to the budget cuts, which are even more delightful!

Department of State and USAID: $25.6 billion, -28.3%

Extremely Biblical: This money has been spent on false Christians including Muslims and Catholics, foreign cultists and strangers!

Romans 16:17 – Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.

Galatians 1:8 – But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.

Department of Agriculture: $17.9 billion, -20.8%

Extremely Biblical: We are on Earth to get a speedy entry pass into Heaven, not to overindulge ourselves with gluttony.

Luke 4:4 – And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.

Department of Labor: $9.6 billion, -21.4%

Extremely Biblical: We acknowledge that man should work but if someone fails to attain this, it is because of his failure to have Faith™ in Jesus and pray properly.

2 Thessalonians 3:10 – For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.

Philippians 4:19 – But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.

Matthew 6:31-32 – Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

Department of Justice: $16.2 billion, -20.2%

Extremely Biblical: Jesus will judge us. The current system of false judges is just undermining Trump’s attempts to protect us and it must be ousted by a Godly judiciary system that assumes guilt unless proven innocent!

James 2:10 – For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.

Acts 10:42 – And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.

Department of Health and Human Services: $65.1 billion, -16.3%

Extremely Biblical: The failed health services will be eventually replaced by Prayer Healing. Those who have adequate Faith™ will be healed and the others won’t deserve it anyway!

Acts 4:30 – By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

James 5:16 – Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

Department of Education: $59 billion, -13.5%

Gloriously Biblical: We need to listen to the Authorities (Jesus and Trump) and read the Bible and that is all there is to it! This can be supplemented by Creation Science for those of us who are intellectually superior to others!

2 Corinthians 10:8 – For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:

1 Timothy 6:20 – O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:

2 Timothy 3:16 – All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:

Department of Housing and Urban Development: $31.7 billion, -12%

Extremely Biblical: It is a good thing to have poor people in order to make it possible for True Christians™ to gather Prestige Points by Charity. It we had no more poor, the Will of God would be soiled. Besides, Jesus never worried about housing.

Mark 14:7 – For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

Matthew 8:20 – And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

Department of Transportation: $16.2 billion, -13%

Extremely Biblical: The only reasons for travel should be military campaigns and spreading the Gospel!

Joshua 10:7-8 – So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.

Mark 13:10 – And the gospel must first be published among all nations.

Those were the principal points of Trump’s Budget. Again, we might be slightly disappointed about His relatively minor cuts concerning un-Godly activities, but, again, it’s just a start and a huge one. Moreover, we must look at some particular examples to see that things are even better than they seem. Some harmful agencies will cease to exist altogether under the iron fist of The Donald! Praise Him! I’ll cite below only some of the most important examples as follows:

Quote: African Development Foundation ($26 million): A foreign aid agency that works on economic development in Africa.

Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board ($11 million): Created by the Clean Air Act of 1999, they investigates chemical accidents.

Corporation for National and Community Service ($771 million): They’re best known for the Americorps program.

Corporation for Public Broadcasting ($485 million): Supports public television and radio stations, including PBS and, indirectly, NPR.

Institute of Museum and Library Services ($231 million): Helps fund the nation’s 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums.

U.S. Trade and Development Agency ($66 million): This agency promotes U.S. exports in the energy, transportation, and telecommunications industries.

Legal Services Corp. ($366 million): A congressionally chartered organization to provide free civil legal advice to those who can’t afford it.

National Endowment for the Arts ($152 million): Created in 1965, they support participation in the arts in communities.

National Endowment for the Humanities ($155 million): They support “research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.”

Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp. ($175 million): They support affordable housing programs.

U.S. Institute of Peace ($40 million): A federal institution that focuses on conflict prevention around the world.

U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness ($4 million): They help coordinate government efforts to reduce homelessness.

This means no more Godless arts, museums depicting nudes in marble, libraries filled with trash and evolutionary lies and fake news, prevention of false Christians and strangers fighting each other thus making it easier to Jesus come Rapture (1 Thessalonians 4:17). Overall, the Budget is even more Biblical than previously presumed! Praise Jesus!

No onto the major disappointment.

EPA: $5.7 billion, -30.5%

Not very Biblical: Why oh why did The Donald not dismantle this hotspot of atheism. Who worries about the state of the biosphere when it’s going to be destroyed in the very near future anyway, as Jesus dismisses this sinful place for a Better One (Revelation 21:1)? We can only pray that the the Republican Congress rectifies this mishap as soon as possible to make the Budget Balanced and Totally Biblical. Otherwise, our soldiers will have died in vain!

1. James Dobson is America’s #1 expert on women’s washrooms, knowing things even I never knew:

Writing in World Net Daily:

“If you are a married man with any gumption, surely you will defend your wife’s privacy and security in restroom facilities. Would you remain passive after knowing that a strange-looking man, dressed like a woman, has been peering over toilet cubicles to watch your wife in a private moment? What should be done to the pervert who was using mirrors to watch women and girls in their stalls? If you are a dad, I pray you will protect your little girls from men who walk in unannounced, unzip their pants and urinate in front of them. If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is today’s manhood?”

So many little-known facts:

A. Women are always comparing themselves to other women, and obsessing over how other women look, but I did not know that they regularly peek into each others cubicles with handmirrors, or that there’s no consequences when women are caught doing it. That’s why nobody will notice transexuals doing the same thing.

B. Indoor plumbing is a lot older than we thought. I had thought than in 1916 only the rich had toilets and for everyone else, stumbling across a man peeing into a bush was a regular occurrence, almost as common as seeing horses and barnyard animals answering the various calls of nature. But I forgot that we’re talking about the good old days, when everything was better, which means that men peeing outdoors is a myth made up by revisionist historians like Howard Zinn.

Howard Zinn’s bush-peeing propaganda is so pervasive that I have false memories as a result. I could swear I remember myself as a kid peeing behind bushes, or even against walls in alleyways. “Boys belong outside” my dad would say, and “indoors” was a strange realm to my generation of boys….Or so my false memories go.

C. Straight teenage boys don’t know what vaginas look like, think crossdressing is cool, almost as cool as following rules, that is.

James Dobson knows that there are non-trivial amounts of straight guys who are plotting to become transexuals just to sneak a peek at peeing girls, all to catch a rare glimpse of that most difficult to see bodypart.

I mean, what teenage boy hasn’t plotted, a least once, to dress up like a girl and sneak into the girl’s washroom? Maybe not because you wanted to, but because it would make you look cool (the only reason teenagers do anything). Everybody has, we’ve only been stopped by the rules, because while teenagers want to look cool, they also know breaking rules doesn’t look cool. Becoming a trannie? Cool. Breaking rules? Not cool.

Some people say this fear is obsolete-by-generations stuff straight from “Porkies” or some other 70’s movie about the ’50s….That today a few keystrokes on google will give you hundreds of thousands of videos of peeing girls. Maybe our thoughts should be less about “Porkies” and more about Pornhub?

Quote: Originally Posted by James Dobson I pray you will protect your little girls from men who walk in unannounced, unzip their pants and urinate in front of them

D. There are urinals in girls’s washrooms. I would have never guessed. Here I was thinking that they just have toilet stalls – because I’m not an expert like James Dobson.

Quote: Originally Posted by James Dobson What should be done to the pervert…If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is today’s manhood?

I for one am here. YOU CAN PRY MY DAUGHTER’S URINAL FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS!

2. He has a style of leadership that Muslims and young people respond to:

On May 30th, James Dobson wrote:

If this had happened 100 years ago, someone might have been shot. Where is today’s manhood?

Less than two weeks later, today’s manhood was in Orlando Florida, and 103 someones were shot.

Not that I condone or support actions like the Orlando shooting, but James Dobson clearly did, and if people respond to his leadership, that is a reason to make him Vice President.

3. His efficiency is so legendary, he once organized a 300-person rally for only $70,000

May Day 2010: A Cry To God For A Nation In Distress cost only $70,000 to put together and was lined with evangelical stars – from Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council to Pete LaBarbera of Americans For Truth About Homosexuality to former Presidential candidate and honorary white man Alan Keyes. The purpose of the event? To reach the heart of God and repent of America’s wicked ways, by shaming America’s wicked homos and seculars.

The event was promoted by James Dobson himself:

Quote: Our nation faces what is perhaps the most serious moral crisis since the Civil War as we’ve turned our backs on God and have clearly displeased him. May Day 2010 is a time to come together and proclaim what God has done in the past, to pray for forgiveness and to plead for God’s mercy on all of us.

The effort was so successful that 300 people showed up. That’s only a bit more than $230 each! Friends, it has never been more affordable for you to give God the money He so desperately needs. Only $230 is enough to put a tea partier at a republican rally! For a mere $2,300 you can have a rally of ten, or overflow the sidewalks with 100 ralliers for a donation of a mere $23,000!

Imagine how liberal false-churches would have spent that $70,000. Feeding the hungry, who would just get hungry again, clothing the naked, which would just make them sweatier and smellier, sheltering the homeless, which was to blame for the mortgage meltdown. Don’t lose your money to those greedy wastrels! Money is best spent on this:

Quote: Originally Posted by May Day 2010.org Join with Christian leaders of all denominations who love God to humble ourselves, pray, seek the face of God, and turn from our wicked ways—individually and as a nation.

This event is not to impress the media or those in Washington, but to reach the heart of God. Publicly repenting and crying out to God for His mercy instead of the judgment our many sins deserve. Repentance in personal and corporate prayer to God and remembrance of His work throughout our nation’s history will be major parts of the day as we seek God to do a great work of revival or reformation in our time. The tentative plan is to begin the day with an hour of worship and praise.

Now THAT is what I call repentance! Now let’s see those homos and divorcees and seculars and, worst of all, Dakota Fanning with sackcloth and ashes, scourging themselves, with gnashing of teeth and rending of clothing and they repent their sins! But of course, they don’t, because they’re so full of themselves, with their gay parades and their arrogant “I don’t need the threat of hellfire to behave decently“.

Well if their gay parades are so great, why can’t they organize ones that only cost $230 per person?

4. He will win the war on terror by working with Muslims, like when he teamed up with an Islamic sex cult to help them teach American kids

Like it or not, we are going to be involved in the Middle East for a long time. We need a vice president who is used to working with Muslims

Religious politics has been a story of strange bedfellows uniting against a common evil. In the 19th century, Protestant churches united to fight Catholics. In the 20th, Catholics and Protestants united to fight non-Christians. In the 21st, we see all religions uniting to fight against scientists:

Youngstown, Ohio students are learning creationism in school with materials from a Islamic, Holocaust-denying group accused of being a sex cult…

Harun Yahya, whom The Daily Beast has covered before, is a pseudonym for Adnan Oktar, a creationist cult leader and Islamic televangelist who owns Turkey’s A9 TV channel. Anne Ross Solberg, an expert on Yahya, explained in a paper that while Oktar uses many of the same arguments as Christian creationists, and “undoubtedly takes inspiration from American-style creationism, Yahya’s creationism is far from just an American import” (PDF). He’s trying to prove that science backs up Islam.



“The message of Yahya is thus that science does not only confirm the existence of an intelligent designer, but divine creation as revealed by Allah,” Solberg writes. Oktar has also hinted that he’s the Mahdi, a messianic figure in Islam, whose coming will signal the end times, and that his fight against evolution is part of fighting Islam’s Antichrist, the Dajjal.

Most likely Republicans are working with him because he knows more about science than scientists. On the other hand, they might be playing along because they got blackmailed:

Oktar has been accused of blackmail where he snared powerful people with sex. “As the criminal indictment vividly illustrates, young girls were lured into sex parties with the promise of being admitted to the group, but ended up having to perform sexual acts with men of influence, whom the group needed for its economic and political success,” wrote the New Humanist, describing the charges against Oktar. “The encounters were filmed and used to coerce the men in question to act in the group’s interest.”

How effective has the program been? I bet Islamic creationists are doing a better job than those cucks we’ve trusted to teach creationism so far.

Christians cuckservatives can hardly convince kids to pull their pants up. Islamic conservatives convince kids to blow them selves up.

Clearly they’re good at their job.

5. He’s used to working with Mexicans. Real Mexicans.

Let’s face it, the only way to get the Great Wall of Trump build on budget is to use Mexican labor to build it. James Dobson works with Mexicans, and not the fake, assimilated ones you see on TV. I mean the real Mexicans, the one who say “Cahones” in every sentence, and who think the age of consent means she’s out of her diapers:

Colorado Independent:

A Colorado Springs man who narrates the Bible in Spanish on CDs and works in the Spanish broadcasting department of Focus on the Family appeared in court Monday in Golden on two felony counts of using the Internet to lure a 15-year-old girl for sex, The Denver Post reports.



…Ovalle, a native of the Dominican Republic, is listed as the “Voice Narrator/Artist” of the Spanish Reina Valera Biblia, available on 64 CDs, and can be heard here discussing an upcoming Focus on the Family conference with directors of the evangelical empire’s outreach to the Spanish-speaking community.

6. He supports bullying

Trump’s foreign policy is not to make war on powerful enemies, but instead to bully our weaker friends. Whether it’s Mexico, or NATO, our trade partners, or even the Vatican, he his plan is to bully them until they end up the sucker, instead of us. He thinks nothing of tossing schoolyard taunts at everyone from cripples to tortured prisoners of war, and thinks calling a woman ugly is an instant-win condition. Clearly his Vice-President needs to share his philosophy.

Focus on Family says anti-bullying efforts in schools push gay agenda

Focus on the Family urges adults to look out for children who are being bullied, and then pile onto them, because bullying victims are gay. Among the approved bullying tactics is showing your adult penis to them.

http://www.focusonthefamily.com/docs…A000000264.cfm

…the boy’s father has to do his part. He needs to mirror and affirm his son’s maleness. He can play rough-and-tumble games with his son…He can even take his son with him into the shower, where the boy cannot help but notice that Dad has a penis, just like his, only bigger.

That’s right. Want your kid to grow up straight? Put him in an environment where he “cannot help but notice” large penises. Works every time.

James Dobson’s Focus on the Family has also posted a delightful series of articles on how to instill your children with the proper “gender identification.” The first piece is called “Is my child becoming a homosexual?” and it basically says that if your child exhibits “gender confusion,”there’s a good chance that he’ll turn into a fruit:

Evidences of gender confusion or doubt in boys ages 5 to 11 may include:

1. A strong feeling that they are “different” from other boys.

So if your son is different from other boys, he’s well on his way to becoming a homosexual. Make sure to stamp out his individuality at all costs, and discourage him from developing any original thoughts or ideas.

2. A tendency to cry easily, be less athletic, and dislike the roughhousing that other boys enjoy.

And make sure that Remember to make up for Timmy’s lack of athleticism by screaming at him during Little League sporting events, and fighting with the other parents.

All heterosexual males enjoy sports because it involves getting hot and sweating with a bunch of guys, taking mass showers, slapping backs and et ceteras, and dominating other guys through physical abuse. Those that engage in this behavior the most are ideal examples of straightness.

3. A persistent preference to play female roles in make-believe play.

If you catch your toddler trying on mommy’s shoes, slap him.

4. A strong preference to spend time in the company of girls and participate in their games and other pastimes.

Similarly, don’t let your daughters hang around boys who like spending time with girls. You can read more about this in another Focus on the Family article, called “Is My Daughter Becoming a Fag Hag?”

5. A susceptibility to be bullied by other boys, who may tease them unmercifully and call them “odd,” “fag” and “gay.”

Pretty self-explainatory.

6. A tendency to walk, talk, dress and even “think” effeminately.

Yes, even if your son walks, talks and dresses like a man, there could be covert gayness lurking deep within his thoughts. You might want to hook him up to an E-Meter and show him pictures of Chippendale dancers to see if he gets aroused. (And if he does, seek professional help.)

7. A repeatedly stated desire to be — or insistence that he is — a girl.

If your child is experiencing several signs of gender confusion, professional help is available. It’s best to seek that help before your child reaches puberty.

And definitely before he buys his first Cher album.

“By the time the adolescent hormones kick in during early adolescence, a full-blown gender identity crisis threatens to overwhelm the teenager,” warns psychologist Dr. James Dobson.

To compound the problem, many of these teens experience “great waves of guilt accompanied by secret fears of divine retribution.”

Fears that are completely justified, mind you: if God catches your son playing with dolls, He’s liable to smack the turdloaves out of him.

In short, if your boy isn’t out there beating up on smaller children, if they get good grades and they like to try to get along with everyone, well, there’re certainly gay. Boys that are bright, precocious, social and relational, and artistically talented are not only gay, they’re “bottom” gay.

6. When he prayed for Obama to be stuck by lightning, his prayer was almost answered:

http://www.9news.com/news/elections/…7203&catid=348

A video producer for Focus on the Family is asking people to pray for rain when Sen. Barack Obama (D-Illinois) makes his speech at the end of the Democratic National Convention in Denver.

Granted, God did not answer the prayer, but that’s only because Obama looks better in the rain. As in, rock-star better:

But of course the prayer was not about looks – no election has ever been swung by some rain, either in the Bible or in the historical record. He was praying for Obama to be struck by lightning, something that God does many times in the Bible. (Job 1:16, 2 Samuel 22:15, Psalm 18:14, Luke 9:54,

)

God did not answer the prayer word-for-word, but He has shown His support for the sentiment, by sending lightning bolts very close to the White House:

: Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you putting all this information together even though your prediction did not come out as expected. ... : My dad being a plumber, I have seen the inside of many women's restrooms. None that I have seen have urinals. Also my dad and grandparents have memories of always being outside. And my grandfathers ...",Satire
128,"Nogales, AZ—An angry Tweet from Donald Trump has enslaved thousands of ‘snowflake’ liberals for the single purpose of building his promised border wall. The President told the press today, “I said the Mexicans would pay for the wall and clearly some of the folks we detained this week are pretty brown, really brown people. Sure, some are just tan because we picked them up in the desert, but some started out that pigment. We are working with the people at AncestryDeport.com to sort out the real Americans from the wetbacks. Don’t worry, folks, many brown people will be constructing and/or paying for this wall. When the Feds swept the desert at the close of Burning Man, we picked up a whole bunch of progressive flakey, hipster-types, and that’s when I told AG Sessions, ‘Hold onto those freaks. I have an idea…”

[Sharks with firggin’ lasers attached to their heads joke removed by the editor]

When asked about violating Habeas corpus, which protects Americans from being detained without due process, Trump said, “We didn’t violate nothing. Haebus whatsus is a very foreign word, it’s very foreign. Foreign stuff translates to my base as ‘not American’. I have worked with my people, the best people, to replace Carpeas whatsus with the words Tweeteas Oftenus. This will allow people to be detained by me, in 140 characters or less on Twitter. Once detained they will become an indefinite part of the wall effort. #WeBuiltThisCity.”

Vice President Mike Pence attempted to quell fears today, “We have real, legal executive authority to detain these people as not having a wall along our southern border constitutes a matter of national security. Most of these folks will be returned to their lives when the job is done, at least those working on the north face of the wall. Ha!”

129,"Tweet Tower—The Trump Organization is looking to borrow money from the Kremlin to help transform downtown Houston from its current soggy state to a lush and sprawling golf course resort. Many are calling this win, win, unless you happen to own property in an existing water hazard. President Trump pitched the idea to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner at a ballgame today, during a flood delay. The President believes an elite golf course with this many natural water hazards will attract “some of the best golfers across the globe. The best!”

Proponents of the plan believe the resort will both revitalize downtown Houston, while cutting costs on restoring water damaged sections. If approved by the city, the resort complex will encompass nearly half of the remaining flooded Metro area. The planned Trump Restored Ultra Mega-complex Pavilion (TRUMcP) will offer stunning views of the Houston skyline as well as provide the perfect spot for special events, weddings, and ongoing rescue efforts.

Trump told rally-goers at nearby Beaumont, “Hey, I said I would drain the swamp, but I never said I would drain this one. Ha! A lot of people are telling me, Donald, if you use Russian bank money for this project they will say it’s more collusion. I’ve had a lot of time to think about the word collusion and what it means to collude. I can even use it in a sentence now. Collude: I loved that old movie When Worlds Collude. That was a good movie. See, I made two sentences! I’m here ’til Friday! No really, I’m being told I should stick around this soggy shithole for the optics. Oh, and I can use optics in a sentence too.”

The President is denying rumors he might “accidentally” nuke Galveston so his new resort complex property will become part of the Gulf coast. When asked about the possibility of using the U.S. nuclear arsenal to sweeten a current real estate venture, the President said, “We’ll see. No options are off the table.”

Meanwhile, General Mattis is angered by the question and warned satirists, “Please don’t give this asshole anymore ideas.”

130,"Tweet Tower—Members of President Trump’s White House are not enjoying themselves and this is becoming even more apparent when it’s their turn on the old chopping block. Whether staffers leave voluntarily or are forced out, parting Team Trump is such sweet sorrow …well, except the sweet part. This is why Chief of Staff General John Kelly was determined to make leaving the premises quicker and more enjoyable for all involved. He opted to install a zipline that spans 1,287 feet and leads from the Truman Balcony all the way to an open sewer grate on 17th Street.

General Kelly told the Discord, “My first idea involved a revolving door, but that implies some aides and staffers might be returning at some point, which is simply not the case …unless they want to be shot. That’s when I thought of the zipline, because it allows staffers to have a little fun on the way out, something apparently none of them experienced here.”

President Trump’s former Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon, is already crying foul. “WTF? I just left?” said Bannon. “Hell, the seat in my office is probably still warm. No really, I started a fire on the way out. Ha! But I love this zipline idea, love it! I would have left weeks earlier, so may I please be fired again? I’ll tell you what, you fire me again and I’ll make-up only positive things about Trump on Breitbart.com for at least two more hours.”

132,"WEEKEND WHITE HOUSE, BEDMINSTER, N.J. In what appears to be a throwback to the days of Watergate, President Donald Trump has reportedly organized a band of so-called plumbers to investigate serious leaks at the White House. Anonymous confidential informants, all members of the White House staff, reported that the president is so disturbed by incessant leaks that he has ordered attorney general Sessions to head the search. Sessions has told other cabinet members that the leaks cannot continue, and that drastic action will be taken to curtail them. He has threatened to subpoena reporters who may have learned of the leaks from the White House staff.

The New York Times, in an editorial today that refused to identify sources, revealed that the current leakage is unrelated to the leak revealed in May. At that time, as reported in a Spoof exclusive, the problem was not technically a leak but was a backup and toilet overflow caused by an an ancient, unpumped White House cesspool. The Times' informants say the present issue is multiple leaks somewhere in an as yet undetermined pipe in the president's bathroom.

Sean Spicer, filling in for the new press secretary as Spicer prepares to leave the White House staff, said that if Sessions is in fact seeking the source of the leak, he would indeed need plumbers but that neither the president nor the attorney general feel that term is acceptable today. Spicer suggested if the plumbers do exist, they be called pipe fitters.

For decades many universities have placed Criminal Justice degrees under the Dean of Liberal Arts. Meaning these degrees were all about history and theory about deviance and social justice. Few liberal arts Criminal Justice degrees programs actually covered police tactics.

Recently as liberal anti-police feelings have grown these CJ programs have shifted to also bashing police.

“I mean, I am a healthy man so we have never needed you to respond to my amazing penthouse in Trump Tower. Believe me, I know how incredible the men and woman ambulance drivers are, these are great people. We don’t pay them a lot of money like doctors and nurses but they do the same incredible work.”

City EMS director Chris Janson had this thought. “After 30 years of being called an ambulance driver, I have gotten used to it. What bugs me more president after president gives a speech in person during police week. But during EMS week, nada… we get shit.”

When asked for a comment Press Secretary Sean Spicer claims the term Ambulance Driver is an “alternative title”.",Satire
140,"As Christmas season continues in full swing, many people are embracing the Christmas spirit by decorating the house, singing Christmas carols and getting in last-minute shopping. However, behind this jovial spirit lays the hideous and destructive nature that the Christmas media does not want you to know about.

Just announced last Sunday, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that the War on Christmas has been named the bloodiest war since America’s involvement in World War I.

The War on Christmas started as a harmless right-wing talking-point about how Jesus is being fazed out of Christmas, but has quickly turned into something far more treacherous.

Although the phrase ‘bloodiest war’ may look alarming, Carter would like to point out that there have been no casualties in the War on Christmas–just a whole lot of blood.

“More people have died from eating cereal than in the War on Christmas,” Carter reiterated using a fancy graph. “However, there been an ungodly amount of blood spilled during this battle—on the streets, at shopping malls, on set during live recording. Blood is everywhere, and as of right now we are still looking for causes.”

The search continues for answers as to where this record amount of blood is coming from, but Carter has a few leads.

“Well, definitely keep our eyes peeled on certain hot spots: malls, offices, Fox News headquarters, specifically Bill O’Reilly’s studio–that man looks like he has a lot of blood in his body,” Carter said. “Our main focus, though, will be various Starbucks to see if any red cups make individuals angry enough to bleed profusely.”

Political conspiracy theories often only cause citizens to be annoyed on Facebook and Twitter, but the War on Christmas has reached new levels of terror, making this the bloodiest, yet least dangerous, war of all time. This may not be the most pressing issue, Carter said, but blood on the streets is something he wants to end.

“I’m not a doctor. I do not know much about the human body, but I know losing blood to a media talking point is bad,” Carter said. “Right now, it’s important to remain calm and remember that the War on Christmas will end when we all put away our decorations and start celebrating the new year.”",Satire
141,"Report finds Firefighters at risk due to exposure to the chemical Dihydrogen Monoxide

It seems everyday there is a new risk to being a firefighter. Chemicals found on fire scenes and absorbed into turnout gear have been linked to many illness. Now a chemical found in fire hose is raising an alarm.

A newly published scientific study in the Journal of Chemical Reaction and Human Hazards in Extreme Workplace Environments, sheds light on this new chemical danger.

According to the study…

Dihydrogen Monoxide is a colorless and odorless chemical compound. At room temperatures it is a non-viscous liquid, but at high temperatures as found in fires it can turn into a vapor.

Inhalation of Dihydrogen Monoxide can cause respiratory distress. Death will result from an excessive amount being inhaled.

Exposure to the vapor from Dihydrogen Monoxide will cause burns. Again death is a possibility with an excessive exposure.

Fire hoses release Dihydrogen Monoxide during normal firefighting operations.

The researchers offered no recommendations on dealing with the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide. There have been no long term studies to check the effects Dihydrogen Monoxide contact has with human and the likely hood of it triggering other illnesses.

More studies on the effects of Dihydrogen Monoxide will be needed to find out the full extent of the danger to firefighters.",Satire

During the debates, Donald complained that George Patton was spinning in his grave because we announced we were going into Mosul. ""Why not go in quiet?"" he asked many times. It was most likely rhetorical, but also so ignorant that one moderator accidentally answered it for him. Also, Patton famously led an insane decoy army to distract the Nazis.

Trump kept referring to a secret military plan to defeat ISIS which he would only reveal after he was made president. This lie was almost cute, like when your boyfriend pretends he knew it was your birthday, or when Mike Huckabee's son says, ""The dog was ritually murdered this way when I found it!"" But I don't think Trump was lying! He really thought he had solved ISIS when his very good brain invented the ""sneak attack."" Paradoxically, he knew it was brilliant, but also so obvious that the generals were stupid for not thinking of it. I know a lot of absurdity is getting thrown around in this article, but he actually said that, and Mike Huckabee's son actually murdered a dog. And Trump's proctologist absolutely adds buttholes to all flesh he touches. It happens so often that he's stopped apologizing for it.

From what I can tell, the rest of Trump's military tactics are made up entirely of war crimes. One morning, convicted fraudster Donald Trump called in to a talk show to suggest we kill the families of terrorists. In one of his first executive briefings, he asked three times why we can't use nuclear weapons if we have them. That's his understanding of modern warfare -- he thinks all the bad people travel in one bombable group, moving to a new town every time the guileless United States military announces it's coming. Which means their only weakness is the first president with enough balls to instantly and without warning murder their children.

Remember how we were definitely 100 percent sure we were going to nuclear war with North Korea and then we all forgot about it a week later because a new story developed? It works both ways. Trump isn't being impeached by lunchtime, probably not at all, despite what everyone is screaming on Twitter. That doesn't mean progress isn't being made!

Nate Silver's website, FiveThirtyEight, has reported evidence that you have actually managed to stunt right-wing movements around the world just by being so shitty. The truth is startlingly clear now: You are intentionally being the world's worst leader, selflessly sacrificing your own legacy -- and indeed, your own dignity -- in order to stop the progress of the far-right and make the world a better place. And boy are you doing a great job. You are a tragic, misunderstood hero, and while history may paint you as a villain (all according to your ingenious seven-dimensional chess plan), we would like to take a moment to offer an ode to your accomplishments.

Nate Silver explains that there's a solid pattern evident: The warmer a foreign leadership candidate's relationship with Trump, the worse he or she has tended to do in elections. This remarkably consistent trend has seen right-wing parties face embarrassing results in Austria, the Netherlands, France, and the UK.

Turns out that during Donald Trump's presidential campaign, not only was he selling record numbers of ugly hats (don't hate, you know it's true), but his cadre of questionably scrupled pals also had a few more undisclosed meetings with Russians than we were aware of. And by ""a few"" I mean 18. 18 undisclosed contacts with Russians.

A lot of these contacts seem to be between Michael Flynn, disgraced national security advisor, and Sergei Kislyak, Russian supermodel and ambassador. The nature of the contacts was email and phone calls. Can we assume a romance? It's up to the FBI to find the sexts.

147,"So Donald Trump thinks it would be a great idea to have a military parade down Pennsylvania Avenue for the Fourth of July.

Let me guess: Mexico is gonna pay for it. New York Times:

President Trump said on Monday that he was looking into staging a display of American military might in a Fourth of July parade down Pennsylvania Avenue. In remarks during a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France at the United Nations, Mr. Trump said he got the idea after watching the Bastille Day parade in Paris with Mr. Macron in July. During the parade, he could be seen gesticulating and whispering to Mr. Macron at the elaborate display of tanks, soldiers on horseback and military jets flying overhead. “I came back and one of my early calls were, I think we are going to have to start looking at that ourselves,” the president told Mr. Macron. “We are actually thinking about Fourth of July, Pennsylvania Avenue, having a really great parade to show our military strength.”

Lou Dobbs and the Fox News retired white general of the day Jack Keane think it's a ""grand idea.""

Dobbs tweeted: ""Bring Back Our Parades!""

The ""our"" is right-wing jingoists who love the military but don't enlist. In fact, it's kind of amazing how many right wing tv personalities and thought-leaders wouldn't be able to march in a US military parade:

MIAMI — Just minutes after being freed from a stuck elevator in a low-cost housing building, HUD Secretary Ben Carson became stranded on an escalator that suddenly stopped working.

“I went to my place of inner peace and found calm in the storm,” Carson told reporters after they finally coaxed him to walk up the 20 or so non-moving escalator steps.

Carson had remained standing on the escalator and gently swaying for nearly 15 minutes before an NBC reporter took him by the arm and led him up the stairs.

“My decades being a neurosurgeon taught me that there are no challenges in life that we cannot overcome with serene thought and prayer,” a visibly relieved Carson said as he hugged strangers and reporters alike.

Low-cost housing tenants protesting against Dr. Carson’s push to implement Donald Trump’s $62 billion cut to housing assistance say the escalator made a squealing noise before slowly coming to a stop, leaving Carson standing about 2/3 of the way up.

“He looked up at all of us waiting for him on the second level but he just stood there,” said one onlooker.

“Didn’t move a step even though we were all telling him to just — you know — walk up the stairs. Weird stuff, gotta say.”

NBC 6 Miami reporter Alina Machado finally went down the stairs and convinced Carson he didn’t have to wait for the escalator to be repaired and then was able to lead him to the top by the elbow.

“I’m not certain what was going through Secretary Carson’s mind that made him believe he was stuck on the escalator. Nope. I have no idea whatsoever,” Machado said in her news bulletin afterwards.

“Dr. Carson became a bit emotional when he stepped off the stalled escalator. We were all very confused.”

Carson (65) has often referred to himself as a ‘cloud person’, a term he has never clearly defined when pressed by media or even colleagues. The New York Times has frequently used the term ‘atypical thinker’ to describe Carson after interviews where he has offered opinions on everything ranging slaves having been immigrants to the pyramids being built to store grain and brew whiskey.

“When things happen on the outside, we need to listen to our inside’s outside and outside’s inside,” Carson told the small, confused crowd before wandering off in the direction of the mall’s food court.

Secretary Carson’s communications aide was unable to clarify this comment for reporters.

NEW YORK — Back safely in Trump Towers after a harrowing 2-hour visit to devastatingly flooded Louisiana, Donald Trump announced a huge humanitarian gesture late this afternoon.

He ordered his private 747 to be loaded up with Make America Great Again hats in the full range of color options and flown immediately back to Baton Rouge.

“I always help everybody. I mean, I really help. I help so much it’s incredible,” said Trump in a series of tweets earlier today.

“And today I saw a lot of sad Louisians who need help. I could see it in their eyes. I’m very good at reading people’s eyes,” Trump continued in a tweet.

“And I noticed a lot of heads without hats. Sad. And some people are saying I flew in just for a photo op. The media is so dishonest. Terrible. Awful.”

“And some people are saying I should help. The governor John Bel Edwards…a Democrat by the way…said I should help or stay the heck away. Not a nice man. Mean.” “So I’m helping. My jet will leave within a few hours filled with thousands of hats. Tens of thousands of hats. They’re great hats. The best hats ever, some people are saying.”

“Those poor, wet Louisians will have Make America Great Hats by tomorrow. Lots of them. I always help everybody.”

New Trump Campaign Chief Executive Stephen Bannon told the N.Y. Times that the hats will be available at the reduced price of $29.99 and there will be a limited supply of Trump Pence t-shirts available.

WASHINGTON — After briefly restating that there was no collusion in his 5 or 6 unreported meetings with Russian contacts, Jared Kushner surprised reporters this afternoon by leaning forward and pointing out some faint wrinkles around his eyes.

And then inviting a cameraman to touch his “dull, limp, lifeless hair”.

“These lines? These crow’s feet? This is what all the fake news about Russia and Putin is doing to me! I have crow’s feet! And my hair has totally lost its bounce and sheen!” Kushner said emotionally before pointing out the bags under his mahogany eyes.

“The pressure is constant and I’m seeing its horrible affects on me in the mirror 20 or 30 times a day,” said Kushner.

“I’m only 34 years old and these unwarranted attacks are stressing me out — the wholesome, youthful appearance that I’ve prided myself on is fading even as we speak,” continued Kushner (36).

Kushner serves as Senior Advisor to the President — his father-in-law Donald Trump — and is currently embroiled in multiple investigations into Russian manipulation of the 2016 federal election. He spoke to reporters about his complete innocence and the sadness of “losing his boyish good looks” but refused to answer questions about saying it was all Donald Trump Junior’s fault during his closed-door grilling by both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.

“So…after much memory searching, it turns out I did meet with 6 or maybe 7 groups of Russians. But I go to dozens of meetings every week at the White House, in various hotels, in cars, sometimes out of the country — it’s easy to forget 7 or perhaps 8 meetings with Russians,” Kushner said before turning back to his worries about his appearance.

“Yes, my friends tease me about looking like an innocent, clean-cut teenager but it’s just locker room talk. Boyish looks aside, I am totally focused on fixing everything that’s wrong. Fixing. Every. Single. Thing,” he said.

“What CNN, the New York Times and Hillary Clinton are doing should be illegal! They’re giving me worry lines and oily skin. And this…,” said Kushner as he stuck out his heavily coated tongue saying it’s further proof that the pressure is affecting his youthfulness.

White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci issued a brief statement immediately following the media show-and-tell defending Kushner’s “health and beauty concerns” and noting Kushner was runner-up to Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson as People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive in 2016.

151,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Since assuming office on January 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump has periodically exchanged messages with intelligent extraterrestrial life forms who, according to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, have provided him with advice and guidance on a multitude of issues ranging from job creation to national security.

“They know he’s an excellent negotiator – probably the best our planet has to offer – and that’s why they’ve elected to speak with him,” Secretary Sanders told a handful of reporters during an off-camera briefing on Wednesday. While Sanders could not comment on the extent or frequency of the encounters, she said President Trump is “extremely humbled” to be the first head of state to make contact with alien life.

While senior White House officials and even Trump’s immediate family are reportedly barred from attending meetings between the president and his extraterrestrial advisers, sources close to Mr. Trump say the president has hinted that he’s negotiating a deal with the aliens that will make America “better than anyone ever thought possible.” However, due to the secrecy surrounding President Trump’s private encounters with the extraterrestrials, the terms and precise nature of the deal remain unclear.

During an interview with Fox News host Shepard Smith, President Trump’s longtime friend and dentist, Dr. Charles H. Brister, DDS, said the president believes he was chosen by the aliens for a reason. “At our last session, [the president] told me how grateful he is to have these beings in his corner, particularly considering how unfairly he’s been treated by the media,” Dr. Brister said, adding, “He’s the only one capable of doing this and he knows it. That’s why the American people elected him.”

In a statement released Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that, despite the implications, President Donald J. Trump has not yet met face-to-face with the allegedly intelligent beings. As to whether Mr. Trump will have his own close encounter of the third kind is, according to the White House, “between the president and his ET counterparts.”",Satire
152,"YONKERS, Ny. – Hillary Clinton was hospitalized with exhaustion on Thursday after the former Secretary of State signed a record-shattering one thousand copies of her new book, What Happened, during a book signing event at a Manhattan area Barnes & Noble.

Witnesses say the former Democratic presidential nominee appeared to lose consciousness moments after signing the 1,000th copy of What Happened for a loyal fan. “She stood up like she was about to say something and then she kind of staggered backwards before falling face first into a chest-high stack of books,” Maria Rodriguez, a lifelong Clinton supporter and mother of six, told The New York Times.

Clinton, whose bestselling account of why she lost the 2016 presidential election to former reality TV star and billionaire entrepreneur Donald J. Trump has sold more copies in its first week than The Art of the Deal sold in a year, is said to be recovering at Manhattan’s Mount Sinai Hospital. “Mrs. Clinton suffered some minor bruising but we expect her to make a full recovery,” Mount Sinai’s chief medical officer, Dr. Ben Sheldon, told reporters on Thursday. “Rest assured, she’ll be back to signing books in no time.”

Sources close to Clinton say that despite her injuries, the former Secretary of State is “readier than ever” to get on with her book tour. “She let her self go a little too hard today,” Clinton’s longtime friend and publicist, Jacob Knot, told Real News Right Now, adding, “It just goes to show how devoted she is to the American people.”

In just over a week since its release, What Happened has quickly become the most talked-about publication in American history with tens of thousands turning out daily to catch a glimpse of the former First Lady turned bestselling author. “She’s a total rock star,” said Lee Irving, who, along with hundreds of other ecstatic fans, has attended book signings in multiple states. “When you look at the size of these crowds it’s more than obvious how she won the popular vote.”",Satire
153,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump, in an appearance on Fox News this week, accused a CNN news crew of stealing his wallet during his 2020 presidential campaign rally in Florida last Saturday. “Let me tell you, these people are very dishonest,” the President told Shepard Smith on Tuesday. “They came to me asking for a soundbite and the next thing – the next thing you know, my wallet is gone.”

President Trump described the wallet as a brown leather passcase from his own Signature Collection and said at the time of the theft he was carrying it in the right pocket of his sports coat. “These people have their own agenda; they can’t be trusted. You look at CNN and the fake stories they put out, it’s sick what these people will do for ratings,” Trump charged before adding that the Secret Service is spearheading an investigation into the incident.

While refusing to elaborate on the nature of the investigation, President Trump told Fox News he has ordered Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy to personally lead the inquiry into his wallet’s whereabouts. “Believe me, this is very, very serious and we’re going to get to the bottom of it,” Trump vowed. “You’re going to start hearing things very soon.” The President went on to say that at the time of the alleged theft, the contents of his wallet included a billfold of approximately five thousand dollars in hundred-dollar bills and a copy of the nuclear launch codes.

Sources close to President Trump say he rarely ventures out without his Donald J. Trump Signature Collection passcase wallet. Designed for the discerning entrepreneur, the leather wallet features an emboldened gold logo and comes equipped with a bill compartment, three credit card pockets, and ample storage space. A presidential profile piece published by The New York Times on Wednesday provided a brief description of the high-end wallet, saying it contained “a pocket-sized photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin and no cash.”

Since assuming office just over a month ago, Mr. Trump has embroiled himself in a seemingly endless war with the mainstream media. In a February 17 tweet, the President of the United States announced, “The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!” During Saturday’s rally at Orlando Melbourne International Airport, Trump doubled down on attacking the “dishonest media,” telling a crowd of 9,000 enthusiastic supporters that he would “speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.”",Satire

Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office.

“After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people,” White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. “This morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed.”

Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. “There are a lot of obvious questions we just don’t have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We can’t be sure,” he said. “All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process.”

Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. “These birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden,” Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds – Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese – are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad.

“Anybody who suggests that America isn’t an amazing country or needs improving in any way shouldn’t be holding a high-profile position like that.

“I don’t see any irony in saying that while also peddling slogans like “drain the swamp” or “make America great again”, no irony whatsoever, no sir.

“Anyway, to business, America sucks right now. Who agrees?”

A source close to Trump said, “yeah, yeah, I know.

“I’m just kind of weary at this stage, to be honest. Nothing is dreadful anymore because I’m numb to it, as are most of you at this stage, no doubt.

“We did ask Donald to read the constitution but he just laughed and told us to shove it up our asses, which again was like water off a duck’s back at this stage.

158,"America’s bums furious at comparisons to Donald Trump

Bums across America have lashed out after Lebron James likened them to Donald Trump.

After the basketball player criticised the president for one of the many ridiculous things he’s done today, bums have insisted the comparison is unfair.

Street resident Chuck Williams told us, “Our lives are hard enough as it is without people thinking we share personality traits with that asshole.

“I get that us vagrants get called bums, but really what have we ever done to deserve being put in the same bracket as the septuagenarian Cheeto in the White House?

“Sure, I do a little begging every now and again, but at least I’m open about where my money comes from – you can look at my tax returns anytime you like.

“But I’ve never complimented the far-right, never grabbed a pussy, never reduced international diplomacy to a playground tantrum, never tried to implement illegal immigration policies, never colluded with a foreign power and never used a national platform to massage my own ego ahead of helping Americans that need assistance.

“Surely I should get a pass?”

When asked for comment, Lebron James apologised to bums everywhere, and told reporters, “I shouldn’t have said ‘bum’, I should have said ‘Think-skinned moron’, or ‘idiotic man-child’, or maybe ‘self-publicising imbecile’.

“Sorry about that.”",Satire

North Korea has a new national anthem, and it’s a catchy one, it has emerged today.

Second craziest world leader Kim Jong-un announced the change via state-operated news organisation DPRK News this morning.

He proclaimed, “Citizens of this glorious country, our national anthem will today be changed to a good little tune I stumbled across, quite by chance and in no way related to a recent speech at the UN, called ‘Rocket Man’.

“I have heard some rumours that the people of our glorious land are spreading lies and falsehoods about me. And I feel some of you may have got the wrong impression of me from the mass starvation, suppression of the media and the authoritarian rule and that sort of thing.

“Hopefully this will help you understand me better. It’s part of my job, you see, to pour money into our missile programme.

“I’m worried that it’s gonna be a long, long time, but I hope that one day you’ll find I’m not the man you think I am at home.”

He clarified “Oh, no no no, I AM a rocket man – but I’m actually quite a nice guy, too.

“So I hope this anthem will draw us all together as we face the ongoing threats from the unhinged maniac in the White House.”

US President Donald Trump has yet to respond to the news, as he is reportedly very busy looking at the footage of his UN speech and counting the number of people present so he can quadruple it before boasting of his ‘crowd size’ on Twitter later today.",Satire
160,"A small Ohio town that exhumed the bodies of Confederate soldiers and discarded their remains in a dirty lake has inspired Ohio Governor John Kasich to enact legislation allowing other cemeteries to do the same. He signed an executive order this morning waiving the protections granted to the graves and memorials of Confederate veterans in the state.

Speaking out against Confederate monuments

“We owe a great deal of gratitude to history and the brave men and women who have fought and died to make this great country what it is today,” read a statement released by the governor’s office. “However, we are a divided people. Gone is the nation that looked past its racist, violent history in favor of that warm tale where everyone was equal and the future was bright.”

“Confederate monuments in public spaces are nothing more than grotesque reminders of the fake news that once threatened our great republic, and which threatens us again today. Let’s leave memories of the Confederacy where they belong — on the internet — and reclaim this great land for more righteous mistakes and tragedies yet to come,” the statement concluded.

A state governor supporting the desecration of veteran graves is a highly controversial escalation in the nationwide debate over the place Confederate statues and memorials have in contemporary American society. A white nationalist rally that turned violent in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12th brought renewed attention to the divisive issue and led cities across the country to remove Confederate monuments.

Kasich positioning for 2020 presidential bid

Beyond inflaming an already sensitive debate, Kasich’s decision to support removal of confederate memorials while also embracing the concept of “fake news” is a clear political maneuver aimed at drawing support from Trump opponents while also chipping away at the president’s base, which stood by him last week when he questioned whether removing confederate monuments has gone too far.

“This is Governor Kasich preparing for the 2020 presidential election,” said Ohio Republican Strategist Dennis Lovell. “He doesn’t care about dusty Confederate grave sites. Allowing cemeteries to dig up and sexually molest the remains of confederate soldiers is clearly a polarizing move, sure, but the governor is banking on the majority of Americans favoring unity and being done with Trump come the next election, and he wants to be remembered as a leader willing to take the radical steps necessary to bring this country back together.”

Activists take bizarre liberties with Confederate corpses

In Delaware, Ohio, where the controversial “#exhumeconfederates” grave digging movement started last week when government officials sanctioned the exhumation of Confederate soldiers, it’s been reported that the skeletal remains of several bodies were used as props in public sex acts performed by a group of ANTIFA protesters camping on the property.

Kasich’s order ensures cemeteries won’t face legal repercussions for exhuming confederate remains, but says nothing about how the bodies must be handled or discarded, opening the door to more bizarre forms of desecration.

Joseph Diggins, an employee at the cemetery, was tasked with exhuming some of the bodies and corroborated a number of troubling reports.

“We were trying to dig everyone up and get them dumped in the lake without drawing much attention, but the anti-Trump crowd picked up our scent from their tents and rushed over to snatch a couple of the caskets,” Diggins explained. “The remains were obviously fragile and that led one group to crush a skull on the pavement and smoke the powder out of a crystal meth pipe they were passing around.”

Trump, Kasich have opposing views on desecration of Confederate graves

Governor Kasich has not commented on the troubling reports or offered a strategy for preventing further depravity as hundreds of state cemeteries begin exhuming their Confederate dead.

The governor has spoken out against Trump’s position, however, tweeting he was “disappointed” by the Phoenix speech where the president condemned those digging up dead bodies.

I've repeatedly encouraged POTUS to unite our country. It was disappointing that last night in Phoenix, he once again refused. 1/ — John Kasich (@JohnKasich) August 23, 2017

Trump asked American’s to stop disturbing Confederate grave sites.

“Folks, our Confederate soldiers should remain buried in the ground, OK? Government officials, protesters, whoever — they shouldn’t be mining Confederate bone dust or molesting corpses. Leave the bones alone. That’s what I’m telling everyone. I speak to a lot of important people, and I say, ‘Leave the bones alone,’” said Trump at the rally. “They fought for America. They were buried in some of America’s finest coffins, by the way — wood that was actually luxurious for a dead body, not those cheap egg carton coffins China’s making today — and now, what, we’re digging them up and wasting all that wood? I could probably build one of the finest properties in the world with that wood — maybe a little steel, too; I’d need maybe a little, maybe a little — but no, no, these people? No values. No business sense. They probably won’t even sell the uniforms. I’d sell the uniforms. I don’t know. It has to stop.”

The president also took his concerns to Twitter the following day, speaking out against Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz), who he called “weak on grave digging.” There was no response to Governor Kasich’s criticisms or plans for executive action.

Both sides brace for extended grassroots protests

While the political maneuvering continues, right wing activists and white nationalists are preparing to mobilize across the state of Ohio, hoping to halt or at least slow down the destruction of confederate corpses.

“It goes without saying that desecrating veteran graves is taking things a little too far,” said Ruth Ballman, the leader of Ohio white nationalist group The Pink Panthers. “If our Republican governor thinks he can turn his back on his people like this and not find a thousand rotting slave corpses hanging at the statehouse, he has another thing coming. We’re ready to dig our way back to the 19th century if that’s what this governor wants.”

On the left, ANTIFA gypsies admitted they’re mostly looking forward to the increase in Confederate bone powder, which is believed by many to be a mind-altering substance that intensifies ones positions on racism, morality, history, and reality.

“We’re going to snort these bones up and probably just kill each other,” said a leftist activist camping out at one Columbus cemetery. “Fuck it.”

34 people overdosed on heroin at a block party held on Lincoln Avenue over the weekend in the Northwest Neighborhood. Firefighters and EMS responded but gave up after reviving 5 people only to see them overdose again several minutes later. Everybody died.

A lizard named Soldier Slim Master Tucker Carlson III was reported missing from an apartment on North Sandusky Street early Sunday morning. The owner told police he feared the lizard was being forced to serve in the military due to his name. Police escorted the man to mental health facility and had him euthanized. They do not know whether an actual lizard exists and reportedly do not give a shit.

162,"Downtown Delaware, Ohio watering hole The Solar Saloon has announced it will convert to a gay bar sometime this fall.

The move comes after the recent Solar Gate controversy threatened to ruin the existing establishment, according to sources close to the bar. Hundreds of negative reviews and the #SolarGate hashtag emerged on social media this week after the bar’s owner, Ron Limpledick, allegedly directed racist and homophobic remarks toward a customer.



Limpledick denies the claims and says the decision to become a gay bar proves he isn’t prejudiced.

“Gays, slants, spooks — I love everybody,” Limpledick said. “I’m re-opening the Saloon as a gay bar so that there’s a safe, inclusive place for all of these outcasts to gather regardless of their inferior race or sexual orientation.”

According to reviews and reports from those at the bar the night of the incident, Limpledick called an African American customer a “Fancy nigger fuck boy” after the man ordered a Gin and Tonic.

“It was strange,” said Jan Marvula, who witnessed the interaction. “Racist and offensive, but said in kind of a sultry voice, like he was flirting. Beyond shivering a little bit and experiencing an intense urge to flee the establishment, I wasn’t sure what to make of it.”

Limpledick confirms he was sexually aroused but says the comment was taken out of context.

“It was a question,” Limpledick said. “I was asking him if he was gay. I’m not, by the way—you know, not officially—but if he were I was going to try selling him one of our new solar powered penis pumps.”

Limpledick says more solar powered sex toys will be sold as part of the bar’s transition.

The alleged victim, Yung Custodian, said he forgives Limpledick and hopes he gets help.

“He once asked to photograph my dick on a solar panel and I said no because I’m straight. He’s been an asshole ever since,” Custodian said. “Last week he said he was working on a solar powered time machine that would take us back to 1808 where he’d make me work as his gay slave or some shit. I hope he finds Christ.”

163,"Let’s face it, there’s nothing you can do about your heroin addiction. You can, however, limit the risk of death when you accidentally (and inevitably) overdose. One way to do that is to shoot up in safe, public places that are close to medical intervention but off law enforcement’s radar.

This list, compiled by Delaware Ohio News in collaboration with local junkies, provides the 6 safest places to overdose in Delaware based on two safety factors: The likelihood of being saved and the likelihood of being arrested. Spots with low risk of arrest and high likelihood of medical intervention are the ones that topped our list.

So, without further ado, let’s review the top 6 places to get smacked and narrowly avoid your untimely demise.

6. The Blue Tube Slide at Mingo Park

The blue tube slide at Mingo Park is great because it provides a unique and even tranquil setting for mainlining your way into the dark abyss. It’s safe because there will eventually be children trying to use the slide, meaning you’ll be found sooner than later. The risk of arrest is lower here given law enforcement’s desire to avoid traumatizing kids and families more than they have to. Watching you foam at the mouth and come back to life among a swarm of first responders is enough for one day.

5. Zion United Church of Christ

This place of worship provides excellent cover for heroin addicts thanks to their community shelter. Church officials have said they expect heroin addicts to use the facility and staff the location with off duty police and paramedics. What better place to have your soul temporarily leave your body? You can briefly find God and then fall back to reality in the arms of His righteous servants before getting dope sick and chasing the dragon all over again.

4. Anywhere in the Northwest Neighborhood

Considered the heart of soul of Delaware, Ohio, the Northwest Neighborhood is a historic district that was home to city founders and entrepreneurs in the 1800s. Today, it’s a liberal and intellectual stronghold with a strong sense of community and a dense population of sympathetic families. Fiends can stumble their way through these tree lined streets and never be more than a few feet away from a warm, welcoming family just waiting to nurse them back to health and call 911. If cops associate you with the respectable neighborhood, they’re more likely to let you off with a warning.

3. Carlisle Elementary School

One could argue that any of Delaware’s five elementary schools would make good spots for drug overdoses, but none is safer than Carlisle. The school is close to Grady Memorial Hospital (#2 on our list) and has a comfortable recycling dumpster to rest against while you pump your veins full of skag from a dirty needle and doze off into oblivion. Dispose of your kit in the recycling bin prior to nodding off and you’ll be safe from arrest.

2. The Bus Stop at Grady Memorial Hospital

The bus stop at Grady Memorial Hospital is safe AND convenient. The local transit authority stop provides reliable transportation and the close proximity to the hospital ensures you’re only a few feet away from help when you overdose and begin seizing for your life.

1. The Gazebo at Bicentennial Park (Behind the Fire Station)

Topping our list is the shaded Gazebo at Bicentennial Park, conveniently located directly behind the main fire station in the City of Delaware. This spot is perfect for obvious reasons. It’s discreet enough to remain hidden from plain view of the surrounding roadways and Wesleyan campus; it provides a peaceful seating area with cover from the elements; and it’s right next to the people who will save your life when you take it too far and almost kill yourself.

It’s so close, in fact, that it’s rumored a paramedic once used a blowgun to shoot a Narcan dart over 100 yards, striking and reviving an overdose victim without even leaving the station.

Washington (dpo) - Following the shock dismissal of FBI director James Comey, US President Donald Trump has already announced his next surprise: his 11 year old son Barron Trump is to replace Comey and lead the bureau in its fight against crime. This also makes Barron the head of the investigation into his father’s alleged links to Russia.“I have total faith in Barron’s abilities”, explained President Trump at the new director’s official swearing-in ceremony in Washington D.C. “After all, he’s got great genes. He will lead an independent investigation. He won’t make any allowances for his daddy, who, by the way, can cut his pocket money by a couple hundred thousand bucks any time a certain someone feels the need to poke his nose in some place.”Barron Trump is the third member of President Trump’s family to occupy a high-ranking government post, after the President’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.The 11 year old is to be relatively free to carry out his duties independently. According to inside sources, several of his school friends and a Hulk action figure are already tipped for top jobs in the FBI.The FBI’s cryptography department is now due to be converted to specialise exclusively in developing cheats and hacks for difficult computer games.Meanwhile, Barron Trump seems to be taking his new job very seriously. Even before he had been sworn in, the FBI arrested his former maths teacher Karen Saltzman on his instruction.

You seem serious though. Do you mind if I smoke?Well I’m smoking anyway. Make America great again!Yeah, it was a big decision. Maybe the biggest ever. Almost as big as my election victory in November. They all said it was impossible, Crooked Hillary was gonna win. But then I won the greatest victory in history. The greatest!Global warming. How long will it take for the US to feel serious effects? These eggheads, what are they called again? Oh yeah, scientists. Anyway, they say that it’ll be really bad in 15 or 20 years. I’m 70 now and in 10 years tops I’ll be dead anyway, embalmed and lying in my gold mausoleum in Washington D. C. Why would I care about the climate?Ah, they’re rich. They’ll be fine. Ivanka, for example, is smart, rich and very sexy, too. The dream woman if you ask me. The planet can’t possibly get as hot as her.Well, to start with, the agreement was very unfair to the USA. At least, that’s what Steve Bannon and someone on FOX News told me. Also, why would I care about the climate in Paris? I might have reacted differently if it was the Pittsburgh climate agreement. Aside from that, one of my most important goals is to reverse everything that was put into place by this Obama [spits on the floor in disgust]. And: make America great again!We will do the opposite! We want to at least triple our carbon emissions by 2020, maybe even double them! No President before me has ever achieved that. We will do everything possible to reach this ambitious goal. We will convert our electric chairs to use combustion engines and wind turbines will turn backwards and consume electricity. If necessary, we will build factories which don’t even make anything. They’ll just burn trees and produce smoke. And that even has the side effect of generating jobs.That’s nonsense. Climate schlimate. I can’t understand why everyone is whinging again.

Paris (dpo) - Scandal takes hold of Donald Trump’s trip to France. On a visit to the capital, the President of the United States became enraged that the French had shamelessly copied the tower of the famous Paris Las Vegas Hotel in Nevada, USA. President Trump explained that he is fighting back against other nations simply appropriating symbols of American culture in this way.The President was already taken aback when he learned that the French capital was also called Paris, just like the famous hotel in Las Vegas. “At that stage, it could still have been a coincidence,” opined Trump. “It’s a pretty popular name. Paris Hilton’s called Paris, too.”However, when he observed the distinctive shape of the tower, the brazen conterfeit could not be mistaken:“I know a cheap copy when I see one!” the US President is reported to have told French President, Emmanuel Macron, in his fury. “That is practically an exact copy of the Paris Las Vegas tower! And I know a thing or two about hotels and casinos.”An angered Trump was not about to accept any objections from his host, Emmanuel Macron, either. “He had the audacity to claim that it was completely the other way around! As if the greatest country in the world would need to copy from anyone else!”In fact, half the world is in the business of copying American landmarks. “I hear there are several buildings in Egypt that are just poor-quality copies of the famous Luxor Casino in Las Vegas and in China there are even several whole cities that look just like Chinatown in New York.”President Trump explained that he would work to ensure that these impudent counterfeiters either demolish their replicas or pay royalties to the USA.

Washington (dpo) - That man does nothing by half measures. On Friday President Donald Trump announced the USA’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and today news has already surfaced that the power supply to the White House has been entirely converted to run on fossil fuels.White House spokesperson Sean Spicer announced the conversion at a press conference strewn with billowing smoke. “The President is leading by example,” yelled Spicer over the noise of the generators. Coughing, he continued, “from now on, the White House will run exclusively on the energy of the future.”Central heating and hot water will be heated by coal fired power stations and a miniature lignite fired power station will provide the electricity supply. At times of short supply, 38 diesel generators can provide additional power. Experts believe that the fast growing levels of soot will soon require the White House to be renamed the Gray House.Figures were already available showing that energy consumption at the White House have increased by 200% since Trump took office. According to a statement from the White House, this is because, “the President doesn’t like it too hot or too cold so the central heating and air conditioning system are both permanently running at full capacity”.According to Spicer, the Trump government’s medium term goal is to put in place targeted measures to foster non-renewable energies so that by 2020, all American households are supplied in a similar manner.“Now you’ll have to excuse me”, said Sean Spicer in closing, “I have to go and shovel 73 wheelbarrows of coal for this evening.

According to official reports, Rodriguez, a non-US citizen who served eighteen months in Iraq before being discharged after sustaining the ill-effects of a concussive blast in January, died almost immediately from trauma he received from Jessica Clark of nearby Glenhaven when he attempted to repel the morbidly obese woman’s seventh trip back to the all-you-can-eat restaurant’s dessert bar. “Soon as he done it I said to myself, ‘That boy’s got a screw loose standin’ between a fat lady and her sundae cart like that',” described one eyewitness, “But even though he looked real scared, he stood his ground and started begging her, saying ‘Please lady no’, and something about having a wife and kid to feed at home as the big fat cow started mooing, going, 'moooo', 'moooo', louder and louder until I realize she’s saying ‘move’, but he wouldn’t back down. I aint never seen nothin' braver.” After an estimated 30 second stand-off, Clark struck Rodriguez over the head with a clubbed fist, then stomped his prone body once before pouring a seventh large bowl of vanilla-chocolate swirl ice cream topped with hot fudge, brownie bits, M&Ms, peanuts and rainbow jimmies which she consumed inside of three minutes, well before the police arrived. Commented Country House Buffet manager Chuck Patterson, “For Javier it was not only about protecting the business he depended upon to provide for his family. It was something more. There was something about witnessing a very overweight person sweat while consuming fifteen fried fish filets, three pounds of lasagna and a gallon of clam chowder in one sitting that his sense of honor couldn’t abide by.” Continued Patterson: “But I blame myself. I shouldn’t have told him what a predicament these people were putting our restaurant in. I should have known he’d try something like this.” In view of Rodriguez’s immigration status and the fact that he will not qualify for the attendant benefits a possible posthumous conferral of citizenship by the US government would bring if he had died in combat, friends and family are humbly requesting donations for a memorial service be sent to P.O.

Thousands of unaccompanied minors who have swarmed across the US border in recent months are beginning to take the jobs of America's boys and girls.

The undocumented children - originating mostly from the violence-stricken nations of Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, were allowed temporary sanctuary for humanitarian reasons but have since leaked into communities across the US-Southwest, putting thousands of American kids out of work, their parents say.

""A couple of Nicaraguans drove my seven year-old daughter's lemonade stand out of business,"" complained one mother from Escondido, Ca., ""She was so sad. She kept asking why we can't just ship those bastards back to where they came from.""

In addition to the immigrants' deep impact on the lemonade industry, hundreds of junior landscapers, car washers, dog walkers and pet-sitters have been rendered unemployed.

Still, the immigrant children are not apologetic.

""This is mercado libro - 'free market',"" remarked a 10 year-old Honduran boy named Juan, ""If I can making lemonade that taste better for less dinero, then this is capitalism.""

""Charlie had us surrounded, pinned down,"" Trump boisterously recalled the hellish day 48 years prior. ""The bombs were falling like rain, and the bullets were so thick, it was like a constant swarm of bees buzzing over our heads,"" he described. ""My general forbade me to risk myself to help my fallen buddies - it was too dangerous, he said - but I could see them out there in the bloody muck, all shot to pieces and blown up and whatnot, and I could hear them crying for help – and I knew I would go. I had to go."" Occasionally sliding off script to emphasize the extent of the awe he, ""And everyone else,"" shared for his brave actions, Trump recounted how he organized just half a platoon of Marines to repulse over 3,000 enemy troops during the harrowing fight. ""Charlie had the high ground, but luckily we had me, and leading a squad of guys around their flank, I put my M-16 on full automatic and mowed down an entire company of VC - KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA!"" the President, swinging an invisible rifle over the audience, imitated the sound of automatic gunfire.

""Though I doubt he would say that he didn't do anything that lots of other guys would have done if put in the same position.""

174,"Trump Vows, ""Swift and Utter Anihilation"" of Small Island Nation of Mauritius

In an addendum to his address to the United Nations Wednesday, President Trump promised, ""Swift and utter annihilation of Mauritius,"" during a press conference with members of the international media this morning.

""It will be fiery, and it will be utter. This, I can promise you,"" Trump remarked before abruptly leaving the podium.

The President's dire oath has left leaders of the tiny island nation best known for it's beautiful white sandy beaches and once being the native habitat of the now extinct dodo bird perplexed as to how they have been targeted for destruction.

""What did we do?"" Mauritius President Ameenah Gurib pled. ""We are a peaceful country. Please, we don't want any trouble.""

Gurib's words seem to have fallen on deaf ears however, judging from Trump's twitter feed.

""Too bad about Messy Mauritius, but looks like they're going the way of their own dumb dodo. Extinct! Too bad,"" the President tweeted this afternoon.

And then, later in the day:

""What is Mauritius? Where is Mauritius? Who cares? It's history. So sad,"" he wrote.

As to the source of Trump's sudden ire towards Mauritius, speculations ranging from a Tripadvisor review that negatively compared accommodations at Trump's own Mar a Lago resort with those experienced on the island nation to an expression of boredom the country's UN delegate might have made during the President's speech Wednesday have abounded - but none of which is currently relevant, says UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who has called for an immediate evacuation of the island.

175,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Married father-of-two and American citizen Sean Spicer has vehemently denied ever holding the position of White House Press Secretary in a hastily assembled press conference on his front lawn this evening.

Mr. Spicer, who prohibited any video recordings of his short speech, told the gathered media outlets that reports that he served as White House Communications Director and Press Secretary from January to July 2017 were “fake news”.

“I am not now nor have I ever been the White House Press Secretary. I’d advise anyone who wants to hear from the White House should continue to consult the President’s Twitter timeline like the rest of us.” – Mr. Spicer

“These allegations are totally false and constitute fake news. It is my understanding that the President, whom I have never met, will be tweeting something to that effect shortly,” the recently unemployed Rhode Island native said, adding. “I’ll let the tweet speak for itself.”

In support of his claim the 45-year-old repeatedly misspoke, slurred his speech and mispronounced basic words including his own last name, giving those present the impression of someone wholly incapable of any form of public speaking.

“I don’t even know what a Press Secretary is,” he reiterated. “Perhaps you’re mistaking me for Melissa McCarthy. A lot of people do these days.”

Mr. Spicer then proceeded to take a few questions, calling on several reporters by name. He revealed that he was currently unemployed, having recently left his “dream job” due to excessive stress but had recently applied for a 3-month internship at The Onion and was taking Russian lessons in his spare time.

When presented with indisputable photographic evidence of him serving as Press Secretary to President Trump, Mr. Spicer refused to answer and instead slowly faded into his garden bushes.

176,"WASHINGTON, DC(James Ryan Lowe)—Learning that the United States also borders a country to its north, President Donald Trump called for construction of a wall along the U.S.-Canada border.

The proposed border wall, Trump claimed, will be much like the wall to be constructed on the U.S.-Mexico border. He promised the wall will “keep out illegal Canadian immigrants,” whose culture “undermines American values.”

“They’re coming to the U.S. in droves,” a proponent of the wall claimed at a rally. “They’re preaching radical ideas, like that the government ought to provide healthcare for its citizens. They also apologize too much. Here in America, we’re much more inconsiderate than that. It’s madness!”

“I really don’t know what Trump is on about,” a Canadian citizen interviewed stated. “Nobody is trying to leave Canada for the U.S. If anything, we need a wall to keep Americans out.”

Trump also promised that the wall would be financed by the Canadian government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau released a statement shortly after that this claim, of course, is false. Trump did not provide details regarding how he would convince his neighbor to pay for the proposed wall.

At press time, it was unclear whether Trump intended to include the Alaska-Canada border in his plan.

178,"WASHINGTON, DC—The Vice President of the United States of America is said to be in a “critical condition” in the White House Medical Unit tonight after becoming trapped in an elevator with an unknown woman for almost 20 minutes.

Doctors at the WHMU say Pence is “lucky to be alive”, claiming “another minute” in the 8×6 ft. death chamber would have surely ended the Indiana native’s life.

“To be exposed to a young female in such a concentrated dose would be enough for any man, let alone one with such an extreme sensitivity to estrogen,” Dr. Mann told the NY Post. “It’s best that he avoid contact with any woman for a few months, aside from his wife of course.”

A White House spokesman claimed the V.P. had become momentarily separated from his Secret Service detail, leading to him entering the elevator unescorted. It is believed that Vice President Pence was unaware a solitary female was already present at the time, and as we now know, tragically this woman was neither his wife, daughter or mother.

The mysterious woman, currently being interrogated by Secret Service, was believed to have been fully grown, possibly reaching as tall as 5 feet 7 inches, meaning the Vice President stood little chance of suppressing his natural instinct to accept the woman’s undoubted lust for him.

“The fact that he was able to hold out for nearly 20 minutes without grabbing her is a testament to the kind of man, husband and feminist Mike is,” President Trump later told reporters. “God knows I would have cracked inside 60 seconds.”

According to CCTV the woman did attempt to dash out of the elevator once the VP entered, as is standard White House protocol for all female staff, but she was too late. The video shows the Vice President remained calm initially, casually ordering the woman to stand in one corner of the elevator and stare at her feet, with him doing the same in the opposite end. However, disaster struck once the elevator jerked to an abrupt stop and technicians informed the pair it could be up to 30 minutes before they would be freed.

Pence immediately began gasping for air and desperately trying to loosen his tie as he slowly slid down onto the floor. “I tried to help him,” the young lady screamed as Secret Service dragged her away, but this only made the situation worse as video evidence shows the woman was not wearing a skirt that fully covered her knee, sending the VP into anaphylactic shock.

Luckily emergency services were able to blast open the doors of the elevator in time to save the Vice President’s life and in all likelihood save the young lady from the electric chair.

Pence is expected to make a full recovery physically, however doctors warn the entire incident could result in some long-term psychological issues for the V.P. surrounding women.

179,"WASHINGTON, DC—U.S. President Donald Trump has revealed he is “very angry” at Vladimir Putin for personally recommending the now former national security advisor Michael Flynn.

The American President claims his Russian counterpart had “totally vouched” for Flynn, citing his trustworthiness and reliability as key assets, and Trump admitted he was “incredibly disappointed” in Putin.

Flynn’s ties to Russia were publicly leaked in the media Monday, forcing Trump’s hand after the President insisted he “repeatedly warned” Flynn to “handle it”. However the 45th President maintains he holds his friends in the Kremlin solely responsible:

“Vlad swore to me that this was his guy, you know, this was THE guy,” Trump dismayed, during his weekly conversation with Sean Hannity. “But now, instead of hiding all my secret dealings with Russia, Flynn’s getting mixed up in all this shit himself. It’s terrible.”

“I mean how the hell are me and Vlad suppose to hide our top-secret relationship if we have these types of breaches. It’s totally unacceptable.”

Trump professed he was “shocked bigly” when Flynn first revealed his conversations with Russia, saying he was “hurt” his advisor hadn’t simply gone through him instead.

“At the end of the day, it shows a lack of trust in my ability as a leader, to conduct my shading dealings with Russia myself,” he shrugged. “What else could I do?”

However, always keen to “learn and grow” from an experience, Trump claims he will thoroughly vet whoever Russia selects as Flynn’s replacement.

As for Flynn himself, having now been fired by two Presidents, the 59-year-old simply hopes it’ll be “third time lucky” when President Pence assumes office in a few weeks.

FURTHER embarrassment has been heaped on the Trump administration just hours after it was reported that Jared Kushner was registered as ‘female’ on New York State Board’s voting register.

With the Trump administration in the middle of wildly celebrating three scandal free minutes of the presidency, reports began circling in the media that President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was erroneously described on the White House website as ‘qualified for the job’.

“We’ve no idea how a factual inaccuracy such as this made its way onto the website, but we’re seething,” a White House spokesperson shared, as he crawled the site for any more misleading information.

Kushner, who has been registered as female voter for 8 years, currently has responsibility for the partial re-greatification of America, taking out the bins, cleaning the toilets and achieving peace in the Middle East.

Those in the Trump inner circle have ridiculed suggestions that a trivial story such as this will only help to distract people from the harmful actions Trump continues to take on foreign and domestic policy.

Meanwhile the job of scanning through the rest of the White House website continues.

“Shit, we’re going to have to delete the whole fucking site,” the spokesperson added when he landed on the page for President Trump.

THE Pentagon is calling a state of emergency this morning after social media giant, Twitter, announced it will be doubling the amount of characters users can tweet.

Military strategists and White House chiefs attended an emergency meeting late last night in preparation of the proposed plan, which theoretically increases the chances of another world war by 100%.

The San Francisco-based company said that it was doubling the length of the classic 140-character tweet to 280, at least for a few select users chosen to be part of an experimental rollout, giving the United States a brief period in which it can prepare for a series of 280 character, late night tweets from Donald Trump.

“Preferably, we would have liked more time to prepare for this,” said a Pentagon source, following the briefing, “Mr. Trump has already contacted the Twitter CEO about trying the beta version, so we’re actively trying to delay that from happening,” adding, “these are sensitive times for our country”.

Mr. Trump, who is the first US President to run all state business through the micro-blogging site, is believed to be already practising his “long form tweets”, and said on the platform last night that he is looking forward to working extra hard with the new character limit extension.

“No one said this was going to be easy,” Trump tweeted, referring to the increased workload now imposed on the US President’s thumbs, “believe me, this will be a great challenge and I may need to cancel a few trips, meetings with heads of state, health care, but I promise I will use the new Twitter character limit to the best of my ability”.

It is understood the new character limit is worth $456bn to the world economy.

THE UNITED States has responded aggressively to an aggressive North Korean response to Donald Trump’s aggressive response to Kim Jong Un’s continued aggression in the Pacific.

Acting on a declaration of war by North Korea, in itself a response to what it claims was a direct declaration of war by the US, the White House has declared war on any and all declarations of war by North Korea, stressing that if a declaration or war is made in response to a declaration of war, then the United States will have no option left open to them other than to declare war.

The declarations come after North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-Ho declared that North Korea considered Trump’s outburst over Pyongyang’s continued nuclear testing to be an official declaration of war against the rogue state, and that North Korea would act to protect itself by shooting down US aircraft if it had to, angering officials in Washington who declared such statements to be, by themselves, a declaration of war.

“I think it’s pretty clear who’s to blame here,” said one political analyst, repeatedly blessing himself while trying frantically to call his wife and kids to tell them he loves them very much.

“Yep, this was all completely unavoidable. There was nothing anyone could have done at any stage to stop this escalation of aggression, and now we all just have to say a prayer that the death toll from the inevitable war is something that we can allow ourselves to live with”.

Meanwhile, round-table talks between the two nations have broken down amid a flurry of ‘he started it’ accusations.

PRESIDENT Donald Trump’s decision to extend his onerous travel ban to countries including North Korea has come as a blow to one Pyongyang family, who were set to go on a long-awaited trip to Florida after saving up their wages for nearly forty years.

“We’re banned from entering the US?” moaned Hwan Kwoong, upon hearing the news from a newspaper that he had found in the bushes, which must have blown over from South Korea.

“That sucks. I’m going to have to break it to my family. They were really looking forward to going to the US and trying some of that… what do they call it over there? Oh yeah, food”.

The Kwoong family are among at least a dozen North Korean families whose travel plans out of the DPNK were disrupted by Trump’s travel ban, with everyone else in the country perfectly happy to stay in ‘the best country in the whole wide world’.

“Travel ban? Why would they need to implement that? No North Korean wants to leave our heaven to go to that rotting corpulent piss-stain of a country,” read a statement from the offices of Kim Jong Un.

“Everything you need is right here in NK. We have sunshine, warm beaches, fantastic landscapes and our very own Disneyland which is way better than the real Disneyland in the bloated, soulless US of A. We welcome your ban! We were about to issue one of our own! Thanks for saving us the trouble!”

Instead of taking their holiday to the US, the Kwoong family have instead decided to volunteer for work that will further improve the splendid land that is North Korea, and will spend the next few days making sure that North Korean bullets fly fast enough to kill their targets.

FORMER presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s much anticipated memoir discussing the US election of 2016 has come in for criticism for leaving out the part where Clinton, 65, accepts she is wildly out of touch, WWN understands.

“Her first major act post-candidacy was to sign a 7-figure publishing deal to write a book for people who voted for her, this is exactly how you appeal to the alienated working class who staunchly refused to vote for her. Her finger remains firmly on the pulse of the American people,” explained close Clinton confidant Joe Bastia.

The political tome is a candid account of how Clinton is unable to be candid, preferring to give a calculated version of her experiences which best give the impression of a person humbled, emboldened and more determined than ever to put the American people second after her own ambitions.

The memoir entitled ‘What Happened’ is a detailed account of a small fraction of things that happened that Clinton and her team want the public to know, according to the book’s publisher. However, there are endless examples of instances in which Clinton was touched, moved and inspired by the type of ordinary people her team worked so hard not to expose her to.

“Come on, what do you think she’s going to do, cop to being a rich white person and admit to being like 90% of other politicians. Ha, nice one, while she’s being honest like that she’ll probably tell the public how much they fucked up her chance to be President, the stupid idiots. Dream on,” explained publisher Jerry Klein.

“Yup, there’s like zero anecdotes about she’s now aware the public didn’t buy her champion of people routine… we’re going to sell millions of copies,” concluded Klein.

New York, NY (2:45 A.M.)–Donald J. Trump was welcomed by a rousing crowd at his campaign headquarters in New York City early this morning, as news of his election spread through the crowd.

A seemingly gracious Trump began his speech with a call to prayer, seeking refuge in Allah and thanking Him for guiding the states of Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio to the straight path.

Trump breathed a sigh of relief as he proclaimed the Oneness of Allah, and bore witness to the prophecy of the Prophet Muhammad. The primarily white, Christian crowd repeated after him that they too declared Allah to be the One True God who, through Trump, would bring back manufacturing jobs to the Iron Wall states.

Trump concluded his speech with two raqaat of prayer, followed by a lengthy group duaa’ in which he prayed for a proper understanding of the Qur’an and enough votes in the Senate to confirm his Supreme Court nominee. He also repeated his promise to “lock her up,” referring to his intention to punish Hillary Clinton for carelessly using her email server without the supervision of any male guardians.

Trump is currently in Mecca, where he plans to perform Umrah before meeting with president Obama at the White House. Together, they will engage in the tradition of praying Maghrib side by side before discussing the challenges of the presidency.

While Ballard had somewhat opened her mind to others’ viewpoints after the election — viewpoints like “maybe we shouldn’t dump coal into streams” or “I want my children to have health insurance” — at the end of the day, she still really just likes one race, and one race only.

“Do I wish Trump would stop tweeting out nonsense? Yes. Do I wish he would stop trying to take away my healthcare, sure,” Ballard said. “Do I still mutter ‘Go back to your country’ when my server at Chili’s gets my order wrong, even if they’re a Sicilian-American who was born in Iowa? You betcha. I just thought we’d have that big beautiful wall by now. To keep out the illegals. He’s really let me down.”

While Ballard has admitted that, since November 9, Trump seems like “not such a great guy after all” and is “probably worse than my ex-husband,” she still can’t quite put her finger on why she strongly dislikes the only woman of color at her workplace. When asked about her co-worker, Ballard said, “Just something about her I don’t like,” and then told an anecdote that stereotyped the woman based solely on skin color. “I also really thought Hillary would be in prison by now,” she added. “Obama too. Like that woman at work, there’s just something about him.”

I guess she’s still crazy racist.”

“Oh, I don’t let myself get wrapped up in that Twitter stuff,” Mitchell says. “I’m just excited that we finally have a president who puts real Americans first.”

While many have worried that Trump’s tweets are a distraction from his controversial cabinet appointments, conflicts of interest, and unprecedented refusal of media access, Mitchell has proven the naysayers wrong by refusing to take the bait.

“I didn’t vote for Trump because of what he tweets,” she explains. “I voted for Trump because I want our jobs back from the Mexicans, I want the hundreds of ISIS members coming into our country every day to be stopped, and because I don’t think having white skin is a crime.”

Mitchell proudly admitted similar ignorance to Trump’s social media statements on Hamilton, protesters, CNN, and the New York Times.

“Twitter is just a distraction,” says Mitchell. “That’s why I get my news from real sources: Breitbart, TheEagle.Macedonia, my nephew’s memes, and secret Facebook groups whose names I won’t tell you because I don’t want you to get the wrong idea about me and my friends.”

“We’re good people,” she adds.

While the coastal elites have been fretting about the first amendment and mental instability, Mitchell has never wavered from the prejudice that inspired her to vote for Donald Trump in the first place. Since November 8th, Mitchell has attended a celebration in her all-white church basement, posted five articles about white genocide, and bought a gun to protect herself from ISIS.

How can any of us metabolize what happened to a ten-year-old? Should I be honest and let him know just how bad things are, or do I let him enjoy his childhood, his innocence a little while longer? How much longer can we pretend the bathroom door lock is “broken” while Donald is stuck in there?

Many of us are concerned about how our sons will learn to treat women in this dangerous, sexist climate. In the case of my son, the nation’s biggest tragedy since 9/11 just told him to stop being a pussy.

How am I supposed to explain that our next president is a bully, and also his father?

And how do I explain to my son that our next president is a man who intimidatingly looked over at my ballot, just to make sure I was still voting for him? Should I remind my son that this man is a terrible role model and his behavior unacceptable, just like I’ve been quietly whispering to him for his entire short life?

And when he gets older, how am I supposed to tell them how this all began? That their father admitted to sexual assault, never shared his tax returns, was endorsed by the KKK, and still somehow weaseled his way into the presidency without even winning the popular vote? I used to believe that this country was an equal playing field where anyone can make it with hard work, but now I’m not so sure. I hate that my son has to come of age in such a time of uncertainty and also have blood relation to the cause of it all.

What am I supposed to tell my only son about the loud, nasty man on TV who insults immigrants while hiring thousands of them, including me, his wife? Do I need to tell him anything at all when he is on the TV standing right next to that man?

It seems like it’s always on the tip of my tongue these days; that “Donald Trump is a bad man.” But I can’t bring myself to tell him. Mostly because a man said he’d “send me back to Slovenia” if I did. But in my heart, I am concerned for the future of our country.

One exchange between Clinton and Blumenthal, revealed earlier this year, reads:

“Fyi. The idea of using enchantment spells to arm the opposition should be considered.”

Clinton refutes that claim, saying that the email was discussing strategies to help the opposition rebels oust Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and that it never read “enchantment spells,” but actually stated “private security experts.”

“The email text you are referencing is a Photoshopped internet meme,” contends Clinton.

“We just want to make sure these women know exactly what they’re getting into,” says one sponsor of the bill. “And this is one painstaking and difficult way to do that.”

The new bill requires all fetal portraits to be “detailed” and “life-like”, although it notes that some impressionism will be tolerated if it appears to express feelings of regret.

Though critics have noted current medical guidelines recommend pregnant women avoid exposure to oil-based paints, Rep. Pittenger (R – NC) claims, “We would never compromise on artistic quality in the name of protecting women.”

Women whose paintings fall short of these exacting aesthetic standards can re-submit a new painting after a one-month waiting period.

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-ME) voted against the bill after failing to pass an amendment that would have added acrylics and watercolors to the list of approved media.

Rep. Pittenger states, “I respect Molly, but when it comes to women’s health we refuse to lower the bar. The rich colors of an oil painting can capture details of the fetus that you just can’t see in a sonogram.”

Under the new law, women would be responsible for purchasing all their own oil paints, easels, canvases, brushes, and gesso.

A Hobby Lobby spokesperson praised the bill as in-line with the company’s values, while hospitals and clinics are expected to combat the law, claiming it will be expensive to provide women with adequate studio space.

Republicans in congress recommend any woman who believes she may someday need an abortion begin a two to four-year fine arts degree program immediately.

Pressed for a closing comment, Rep. Pittenger says, “I’ve heard of some women practicing their still-lifes with peaches, but the colors there aren’t quite right. So a background in the arts is absolutely vital, but we won’t be paying for that either.”",Satire
195,"(SP) – Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone named Blake Bortles the team’s starting quarterback today, putting a talented roster into the hands of a quarterback who has been one of the league’s worst over the past three seasons.

But instead of looking outside the team for a better quarterback, the Jaguars instead today doubled down on Bortles — and Marrone believes it will be enough to see Jacksonville win the AFC South and make the playoffs.

“There are many who say that Bortles isn’t a good quarterback and that he can’t throw football near his receivers and that he’s a proven loser,” said Marrone. “And not just many say that. All say it. Because it’s true. But one thing he does do is stand for the pregame national anthem — same as every quarterback who has won the Super Bowl. Sorry, but I think that’s some pretty good company to be in. I’ll take my chances.”

Jaguars receiver Allen Robinson said he is happy that Jacksonville is sticking with Bortles.

“Do I think we’ll make the playoffs with him? No, not at all,” said Robinson. “But knowing that he is somewhere on the sidelines standing up and not kneeling, will make the next three hours of losing 30-10 feel so much better.”",Satire
196,"(SP) – Protesters gathered outside NFL headquarters in New York City today, chanting and demanding that quarterback Colin Kaepernick be signed by an NFL team so he can sustain massive brain damage.

“Colin Kaepernick deserves the opportunity to have his life ruined by the effects of CTE,” said one protester. “The NFL is taking away his right to have a shorter life plagued by depression and violence.”

More than 1,000 gathered outside the league offices, chanting: “CTE! CTE! He’s not free without CTE!” And: “No justice, no brain damage!”

Unlike previous Kaepernick-related protests, today’s included people from both sides of the political spectrum.

“I think it’s racist that Kaepernick does not have a starting job in the NFL,” said one protester wearing a Black Live Matter t-shirt.

“I want Colin Kaepernick to suffer a massive brain injury because he hates America,” said another protester wearing a red Make America Great Again hat.

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell refused to comment on the protesters outside the building.

197,"(SP) – White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee-Sanders announced today that President Trump is set to release an executive order that will ban all Indians from the United States due to the great number of losses being suffered by American League teams.

“This is an America first president, and that includes the American League,” said Huckabee-Sanders. “The president has made it clear he wants to ban Indians, from the baseball kind to the dot kind and the feather kind, until we get this figured out.”

Huckabee-Sanders then added, when pressed by reporters that her dot-and-feather comment was racist, that anyone who accuses the president of racism is merely seeking to divide the country. The president’s spokesperson also refused to comment on reports that Trump ordered the Indian ban after overhearing part of a report on Fox News about the Cleveland Indians winning an American League record 21 games in a row.

“If the implication is that the president was scrolling through Twitter while taking a bowel movement, and Fox was on in the other room and he just heard a brief snippet about Indians beating Americans and then yelled out to Stephen Miller, while still on the toilet, to ban all Indians from our country,” said Huckabee-Sanders, “well, that’s all the time I have for questions today.”

Cleveland Indians manager Terry Francona said his team plans to continue to keep playing as long a they can.

“Our motivation this whole streak is that the world is basically f–ked, so we may as well play our best until the whole thing goes to hell,” said Francona. “This executive order does nothing to change that point of view.”",Satire
198,"(SP) – The White House has announced that Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, resigned from office this afternoon to accept a job as the drive time host on Sports Radio 980: The Yakker.

“President Trump has really enjoyed talking about the NFL and NASCAR in recent days,” said White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “He feels the best way to get out his sports takes is to go full-time into sports talk radio. The nuclear faceoff with North Korea, our wars in the Middle East and Puerto Rico being underwater were threatening to derail his opinions on standing for the national anthem at football games, and so he is stepping away from the presidency effective immediately.”

Trump’s presidency ends eight months and five days after his inauguration, or approximately seven months longer than many expected.

“I feel I was able to accomplish much for the American people in my time as president,” read a statement from Trump following his resignation. “I helped America understand that the NFL is bad and that I don’t like Stephen Curry. Also, I’m told I made a Supreme Court judge. I hope the judge is not Steph Curry and is maybe one of the Pittsburgh Penguins. Please tune into Sports Radio 980: The Yakker tomorrow for more.”

Trump will be joined on his radio show by new co-host Jay Mariotti, while Mike Pence will takeover as President of the United States.

“While I want all the players to stand for the anthem, they have a right not to,” said Pence. “However, I do think they should be fired if they kneel down in a gay way.”

Sports Radio 980’s station manager Mike Thomas says he is excited to have the former president aboard.

“We like strong takes and divisive takes that get people talking,” said Thomas. “There’s no one better than Donald at doing that. I expect huge ratings for a long time, with the added bonus of us probably not all dying in a nuclear war started via tweet now.”",Satire
199,"CHAPPAQUA, NY – Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her NCAA Tournament picks last night, running through the 64-team bracket in an exclusive interview with the mirror in the bathroom off of her master bedroom.

“First of all, thank you for having me,” Clinton began. “I always imagined following in President Obama’s footsteps with these picks and I’m happy to do that here tonight. I want to congratulate all the teams who simply made it to the Tournament, which is an accomplishment on its own.”

The former Secretary of State then moved on to her specific picks, but seemed unable to settle on any teams in what came across as an attempt to pander to the fan bases of all 64 teams.

“Obviously, Kentucky is a great program, but so is Northern Kentucky,” she told her mirror, which just hung their silently, waiting for the monologue to end. “I don’t think you can go wrong with either one and I’ve rooted for them both since I was a young girl, to be honest.”

The bracket reveal was then interrupted when Clinton’s husband walked into the bathroom.

200,"Home Depot Founder Vies to Become Official Sponsor of Mexico-America Wall, Endorses Trump

Is there some rule out there we don’t know about that states that founders of major DIY retail chains have to get involved in politics eventually? We saw that the people behind Hobby Lobby were all too eager to jump out of their lane (craft supplies) when the moment arose, and now and it is becoming clear that they learned by watching the founder of Home Depot, who just can’t stay out of the political arena (made in part, presumably, withPremium Birrill Fir Studs).

Bernie Marcus wrote a piece for Real Clear Politics to announce that he is supporting Donald Trump. Granted, he is a home improvement store founder, so no one really asked him, but he did it, we have it, and we are moving forward with the new information now. If someone were to ask me, I’d say he’s just doing the same thing people speculated Ben Carson and Chris Christie might have been doingwhen they came out in favor of Trump. In the same way there were rumors that Carson and Christie were simply gunning for a chance at being vice president or getting into Trump’s cabinet, I think Marcus just wants to make sure that if Trump gets the presidency, Home Depot becomes the Official Sponsor of the Mexico-America Wall.

Anyway, asking yourself what Marcus’ reasoning is? Here are a few snippets.

A plug for the American Dream/Home Depot came first:

But I draw even more from lessons learned when we founded The Home Depot in 1978 rather than from the contentious GOP primary of 2016. I genuinely believe that if we to started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners. I never forget The Home Depot’s small business roots – we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia.

Next came a just-because sort of attack on media and academia:

Politicians like Obama and Clinton, aided by the media and academia, have peddled a dangerous sentiment that government can provide for Americans better than the private sector.

That shade on media and academia came amidst glorification of the job creation inherent in the founding of small businesses. Note that Marcus took time to praise his employees who have been able to get wealthy without college degrees, but in one quick statement, took a swipe at everyone who works at a university, lab, library, newspaper, television station, etc. So, are jobs really the main focus here at all?

He concluded by targeting the #NeverTrump Republicans:

As a GOP donor who stood steadfastly behind Jeb Bush– and who has contributed to candidates for a generation – I urge all Republicans to stand up and be counted in support for Donald Trump.

In time, we will surely learn the political inclinations of every founder, mogul, and, in Marcus’ words, “young [man willing] to shag carts from a parking lot because he has faith that he and his family can be great.” Marcus is just one of the first of many this election season.

In conclusion, make repainting your living room for the ninth time because you’re so bored and lonely that it physically hurts and maybe a sea-foam green accent wall will fill the void your ex-girlfriend left great again or something.

Trump accepted the award in an emotional speech at the Microsoft Theater, thanking the hundreds of staff members he has fired so far in his presidency, as well as his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

“Oh man, I know I’m forgetting so many people,” he said as the background music began to prompt him to wrap up his acceptance speech. “Spicey, the Mooch, Bannon the Cannon, and all the others I can’t remember right now—you guys made this all possible.

“You just never know what’s going to happen next,” one academy member said on condition of anonymity. “It’s almost like the writers are making totally random decisions every day. It really adds to the tension and excitement.”

“I owe a great debt of gratitude to Pepe, and all who have fought so valiantly under his banner, mercilessly lobbing meme after meme at all of my detractors,” Trump said at the ceremonial presentation of the memorial. “And I cannot forget to specifically mention famous Redditor dank_meme_guy_420, who has created over 300 memes during the war. Just a tremendous, tremendous troll—the very best. A true hero.”

WASHINGTON – After taking a beating in a one-on-one game of basketball against Kobe Bryant today, the President shutout every member of the White House Staff in 48 consecutive games of 21.

“I knew Kobe wasn’t going to let me win,” Obama said. “But after that 21-3 rattling, I made the staff pay,” he added smiling.

The Los Angeles Lakers were visiting the White House as NBA champions. It was the fifth such visit for Bryant and the 11th for coach Phil Jackson. Six of Jackson’s visits were with the Chicago Bulls.

“It was quite funny to see actually,” Jackson said. “I heard all these things about the Pres. being a pretty good ball player, but Kobe took him to school.”

Bryant was pretty pleased with the result, but said he expected to win.

“It was the left-handed thing that did him in,” Bryant said. “He’s got no right-side game, so I all I had to do was block him out on the one side and he was toast.”

Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Obama was especially competitive when it came to their one-on-one game.

“I’ve played a few pickup games against Barack before and I’ve never seen him like this,” Gates said. “He was running around like a madman and swearing to himself. I didn’t even have to let him win.”

Gates wasn’t the only one to feel Obama’s b-ball wrath.

“I didn’t even really want to play,” said Pete Rouse, Interim White House Chief of Staff. “I don’t even like basketball and I’m definitely no good at it, but Mr. Obama was insisting that everyone play.”

While Rouse’s matchup provided comic relief, today’s games showed a different side of the President, a slightly maniacal side. Maybe now the Republicans will see just how much they have in common with him.

WASHINGTON – It’s only a small insert on page 112,115, but the new files leaked by the infamous website WikiLeaks provide almost undeniable evidence that, during his presidency, George W. Bush did in fact make some important decisions for himself.

The documents have only been partially released on the WikiLeaks website, but The Sensationalist Times received an advance copy of the entire contents.

According to records kept by the White House, Bush left most important decisions up to his staff, aides and other people he hired to do shit around the Oval Office. Condoleezza Rice even made a few decisions herself, although her role during the Bush administration remains, for the most part, an enigma.

However, when it came to food, Bush usually insisted he have the final say.

“I ordered those Cinna Stix from Domino’s tonight,” reads an entry in the younger Bush’s diary, which was apparently confiscated by a Democrat ninja and which was released by WikiLeaks.

“It’s not the best thing I’ve ever had. I asked Rumsy and he said he didn’t think it was too great either, so it wasn’t just me.”

Apparently, Bush also decided upon the specific flower types to be included in the White House Garden and put the clamp down on any rumors that surfaced about a possible Nintendo Wii in the White House.

“Laura thinks we should get a Wii for the girls,” reads the diary. NEVER!! I’m a PS3 guy!”

This new information totally dispels the belief that George W. Bush was just a marionette being controlled by a Republican party that knew just about as much as him.

Finally Bush can be recognized for his decision-making prowess. While he may not have known how to run a country, one can no longer doubt his ability to pick an answer in a multiple-choice situation.",Satire 
209,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Overlooked as scandals swirl around the White House, Justice Department, CIA, EPA, and FBI, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said today it could get up to some pretty abusive shit if that’s what it takes to get a little attention around here.

“People don’t think of Fish & Wildlife as being ripe for overreach and corruption, but we can be a real hotbed of intrigue,” insisted regional director Brian Wills-Perry. “We’ve never been asked to hack into phones or doctor crowd photos or attack Yemen, but we could do other stuff. You give me a drone and I can blow a hole in a rainbow trout, no problem.

“I wouldn’t, of course,” he quickly added. “That would be horrible. Animals are our friends. But we could, is what I’m saying, so how about a little media scrutiny for the old U.S. FS&W?”

As part of the Interior Department, the Wildlife Service faces steep budget cuts under the Trump administration, reductions that have been all but ignored by the press, which is focused on scandals at larger agencies. Susan Kaldek, assistant director of the migratory birds division, said the media is really missing a big story by discounting the department’s controversial work on surveillance.

“I’ll bet you didn’t know, because reporters weren’t doing their jobs, that just last year we searched a marmoset den without a warrant,” Kaldek admitted. “And every fall and spring, we capture thousands of foreign nationals. Specifically Canadian Geese. And when I say ‘captured’ I mean in photos. God they’re majestic…

“But the point is, you think our borders are porous in terms of people getting through? Look up, my friend. No wall is going to keep out a great blue heron,” she added.

Fish and Aquatic Conservation director Jim Freeman, meanwhile, said the Wildlife Service is not above a security leak.

“So the FBI leaks Russian contacts and the CIA leaks entire conversations, but what if I told you we’re working on a follow-up to our 2010 report, ‘Early Life Stage Mortality Rates of Lake Sturgeon in the Peshtigo River’ in Wisconsin?” he said. “And what if that ‘accidentally’ got into the hands of Field & Stream a few weeks early? Jake Tapper will be all over my ass.”

Late this afternoon, with the media still focused elsewhere, Freeman was seen carrying a snowy egret, a small staple gun, and a migratory tag out onto the National Mall.

“I’ll do it! I’ll incorrectly tag this egret in a sensitive part of its brilliant white plumage!” shouted Freeman, tears running down his face.

“He will, he’s crazy!” Freeman added, speaking out of the side of his mouth in hopes onlookers would think the egret said it.

One thing we do know is the elusive 64-year-old – who turns the big 6-5 next week, ladies! – arrived in a small plane and refused to take the State Department press corps with him, which confidantes say is no surprise.

“Rex really isn’t comfortable in the spotlight,” says a childhood pal. “Or being photographed or spoken about or explaining himself to anyone.”

That’s just one of the things that makes the isolated envoy so alluring, offers another inside source.

“He is such a hot mystery,” the source says. “Everyone wants to know, who is Rex Tillerson? What does he do? Why is he Secretary of State? You know they say, ‘You always want what you can’t have,’ and Rex really doesn’t given you anything.

“Anything at all,” the source adds.

211,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Republicans picked up a major endorsement today as the world’s leading patient-based health related entity – Cancer – came out in favor of their proposed Obamacare replacement plan.

“Speaking on behalf of the many, many millions of patients for whom I am responsible, the American Health Care Act is a vast improvement on Obamacare,” Cancer said in a written statement. “Several aspects of this legislation, such as eliminating the individual mandate, cutting Medicaid for the states, and increasing costs for the poor, sick and old, represent great strides forward on the road back to where things used to be before Obama got involved.”

The statement conceded the bill is “by no means perfect,” but urged Republican hardliners to vote in favor.

“To my friends in the Freedom Caucus – and my special friends the Koch brothers – I realize this legislation does not have everything we both want,” Cancer said. “To you, it still allows people to get government support for healthcare. To me, it still allows people to get healthcare. But I urge you to join me in supporting AHCA, as I believe this bill takes a giant and much-needed step in our direction by eventually sending many more people in my direction.”

The surprise endorsement was announced Thursday, and without much fanfare, during a briefing by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer:

SPICER: Good morning. One update on the American Health Care Act. Support for this landmark legislation continues to grow. It now has the backing of House and Senate Republican leadership, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Cancer, Grover Nordquist, and medical device manufacturers. Questions?

CNN: Sean, what’s the next… wait, did you just say the bill has the support of ‘Cancer?’

SPICER: Yes. And the Chamber of Commerce and medical device manufacturers.

AP: Right, but Cancer? You don’t mean the American Cancer Society?

SPICER: Um… no. No, I believe they’re opposed. I can get back to you on that.

AP: No, that’s all right. So… Cancer endorses this bill.

SPICER: Yes. The President strongly believes that everyone should have a seat at the table and he has been negotiating with a very diverse group of interested parties, including Cancer, which said it particularly likes dropping the individual mandate.

NYT: Because… fewer people will end up with health coverage?

SPICER: I believe that was Cancer’s primary interest. When it saw that provision, it was very excited. Spontaneously self-replicated. Literally went from a stage 3 to a stage 4.

WSJ: Sean, why would the White House want Cancer’s support when the bill is opposed by hospitals, doctors and patient groups like the AARP?

SPICER: With all due respect to them, Cancer is by far the largest patient-oriented entity on the planet. Every single day it’s in direct contact with more people than either the AMA or AARP, and the President appreciates this wide base of support.

FOX: But shouldn’t the President be against Cancer?

SPICER: No. Cancer has said some very complimentary things about the President, so the President feels obliged to be complimentary in return. As he told me just last night, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could get along with Cancer?’

FOX: But Cancer is a killer.

SPICER: Hey, there are a lot of killers. You think our country is so innocent?

Cancer could not be reached for comment as no one really wanted to try.

212,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – In what it called a “show of great compassion,” the Trump administration today announced it will allow all female illegal immigrants to stay in the country if they rate an 8 or higher.

Critics blasted the idea as blatantly sexist, and pointed out Trump had once promised to only deport illegals with criminal records. Press Secretary Sean Spicer, however, said the new order is “entirely consistent” with earlier promises as, “Mr. Trump believes that being anything less than an 8 is a crime.”

Reading a statement by the President, Spicer said women who qualify for the new “F8+” visa will be allowed to remain in the United States if they meet three criteria: “They have to respect our laws, they have to learn English, and they have to keep their weight down,” he said.

According to immigration scholars, about half the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants in America are female. Approximately 2.2 million of those women are between the ages of 17 and 34, specified by Trump as “the only age group capable of attaining an 8 or better,” Spicer said.

“Through the F8+ program, the President shows his great compassion,” said Spicer. “He will not turn a blind eye toward those who come here seeking a better life, but will in fact stare at them, at close range and from several angles, in both formal dress and swimwear.”

In related news, Spicer said the President will hold a get-to-know-you session with female members of Congress in the form of a, “Ms. Congresswoman Pageant.”

Democrats immediately protested, calling the Senate bill cynical, calculated and malicious. Republicans, meanwhile, claimed they were surprised by the opposition.

“I don’t see the problem. The left claims its pro-choice and we’re saying, ‘Fine, choose,’” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, (R-KY). “The last thing this country needs is an unwanted Democrat.”

“It’s really a liberal compromise on our part,” added House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). “Even though our base staunchly opposes any cooperation with the other side, we are crossing the aisle and saying, ‘Go ahead. Kill yourselves.’

“In fact, some of our members suggested we make abortions mandatory in Democratic districts,” Ryan said. “Honestly, we’re going out of our way here.”

On the Senate floor, Democrats said the sudden about-face on abortion is another cynical attempt by the GOP to reign in the opposition.

“State-by-state and law-by-law, they’re attacking democracy,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-NY). “They’re restricting immigration, they’re making it more difficult to vote, and now they’re trying to literally create fewer Democrats. You cannot claim in one breath that all life is sacred, and in the next breath say some lives are less sacred.”

“Yes we can. Just did,” McConnell responded.

In selecting Christie, 54, The Donald will be bringing in a “yes, I’ll have another” man that won’t clash with his own oversize, portly ego. “I think Mr. Trump wants Christie around just so he can humiliate him,” said Trump’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “and he knows he’ll do whatever he says, whenever he says to do it.”

Despite rumblings of a massive falling out between the two, those closest to the president-elect say otherwise.

Jared Kushner, the husband of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, said a Christie nomination would be a wise one, and would produce instant results. “Mr. Christie’s transition from the gravy train to the Trump train was seamless,” he said. “I think he would shake things up and make an enormous impact.”

Stephen Miller, who played a crucial role in Trump’s campaign, including drafting his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, says Christie has a “gargantuan-sized heart” and is “the perfect fit” for the new court.

“Governor Christie is not only ‘pro-life’, but he understands the birthing process better than anyone I know,” Miller said, “and as far as the 2nd Amendment is concerned, I’ve seen that guy conceal a .30-06 in the crease of his back fat. Trust me, there’s nothing to worry about.” Miller joked that Christie loves and supports the NRA almost as much as KFC. “He will step up to the plate, that’s for damn sure.”

While often referred to as the “butterball” of the “Grand Old Party Sub,” it appears Mr. Christie’s nomination to the Supreme Food Court is already a foregone conclusion.

215,"TRUMP TOWER – Soon after securing the Republican presidential nomination, business mogul/reality TV star Donald J. Trump swore off any and all assistance from the U.S. intelligence community, stating he did not trust the briefings he was set to receive as the nominee. “I won’t use them because they’ve made such bad decisions,” he said at the time.

The Washington Post recently reported that a team of intelligence analysts “has been prepared to deliver daily briefings on global developments and security threats to Trump in the two weeks since he won,” but he’s passed on all but two meetings. Offered daily access to sensitive and classified information from around the globe, the U.S.’s incoming leader — who has no governmental or military experience — simply declined, declaring he’d rather receive his daily briefings over his favorite social media platform, Twitter.

“I like Twitter because it trims off all the fat,” Trump told Fox News, “if you can’t get your point across in 140-characters or less, then it can’t be that important anyways.”

Trump’s team says the president-elect has been focused on the transition and selecting the members of his administration’s Cabinet and say he still has plenty of time to get up to speed on international affairs and security threats before he takes office.

The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, who is also a senior member of Trump’s transition team, told the Post that he is not concerned about Trump’s Twitter preference.

“National security is Donald Trump’s No. 1 priority and he’s taking it very seriously,” Nunes said. “Look how many leaders he’s met with, how many phone calls he’s taken, positions he’s filled. So what if he uses Twitter…he’s getting the job done.”

Mr. Trump has tweeted almost two dozen times in the last two days, including a barrage of multi-tweet criticisms of the press, a violent tweetstorm about the popular vote and possible fraud, and his latest proposal; to jail or revoke citizenship of people who burn the American flag.

216,"Houston, TX- Massive flooding this week left at least two dead and millions homeless as the administration scrambles to deploy thoughts and prayers to local governments in coordination with FEMA and other disaster relief agencies. “We’re just trying to get the thoughts and prayers out as quickly as possible”, a spokesperson for the administration said, “and if we can get the public to have an equally dedicated campaign to collect Facebook likes for these victims, we can really mitigate the worst of this.”









FEMA director Adam Brown told reporters earlier today that “retweeting victims’ posts really helps, please do that as much as possible. This is a serious issue that we can’t just swipe left.” Reports from the agency had indicated earlier today that upvoting could have some impact, but reacting on Facebook with a “wow” or, even better, the “angry face” would most likely be what turns the tide in effective response to this region.

“If you want to do literally everything you can to help the victims in Texas, you should like this article, then share this article, then like the one you shared and then comment so that your friends get engaged and then they start tagging people and everyone talks about how much it sucks and everyone posts pictures”, said President Obama. “Then go relax to your favorite show and have a beer. You’ve earned it.”

Story update: Victims are now saying they have received too many thoughts and prayers and will have to send some back. Houston has miraculously repaired all damage and now has a surplus of prayers while also lowering the deficit of thoughts..

217,"

NEW YORK, NEW YORK — President-Elect Donald J. Trump has already been raising eyebrows with his cabinet and adviser selections.

Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General when Sessions was deemed too racist for a federal judgeship back in the 1980’s. He’s asked Steve Bannon, an executive for Breitbart News, which frequently publishes white nationalist and white supremacist news under the banner of the “alt-right” movement, to be his Chief Strategist. This week he announced that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will be his U.N. ambassador despite having no experience in the State Department, and has reportedly asked Dr. Ben Carson — a chief rival during the Republican primaries — to be his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

At a press conference late Tuesday night, Trump gave some insight into his thinking process in inviting Carson into the role of HUD secretary.

“Well, I mean, you know, he’s um, one of them, isn’t he,” Trump asked rhetorically.

Reporters asked Trump what he meant by “one of them.” The president-elect first just winked back at the reporters. When they didn’t understand what he meant, he tried touching his nose. Exasperated, Mr. Trump finally answered the question in his trademark way.

“Look, he’s one of them, you know what I mean,” Trump said, “you know, his people are into jazz and they have an extra muscle that makes them good sports.”

The press pool was still not quite sure what he meant. Trump tried again to explain to him why he was choosing Dr. Carson for his HUD secretaro.

“It’s got the word urban in it, right,” Trump asked, “and when we think of urban we think of people of a certain…type, right? You know they all smoke marihuana cigarrettes and their women are Jezebels, strong sexual appetites, know what I mean?”

Still, the reporters weren’t quite understanding what Mr. Trump was getting at. He dug in even further.

“C’mon people, follow me here,” Trump implored them, “the job has the word urban in it, he’s an urban. You know, an URBAN. Like, his people are incapable of self-care and sink into lunacy under the burden of freedom.”

Looking puzzled, members of the press pool still couldn’t quite understand what Trump’s meaning was. They pushed for more clarity. Growing ever more flustered, Mr. Trump tried to oblige.

“You know, he could be a minstrel,” Trump offered, “he’s a good song and dance man, get it? Like, he’s not going to go swimming any time soon, no matter how long ago he ate. Get it now? Huh?”

After fifteen more minutes of trying to get the reporters assembled there to understand him, Trump finally gave up. He dug into his pocket, and got out some black shoe polish. He also got out a large rag and started smearing the polish all over his face, except around his eyes and mouth, there he left his trademark orange skin intact. He began singing.

“Everything seems lovely when you start to roam,” Trump sang out, continuing, “The birds are singin’, the day that you stray. But wait until you are further away. Things won’t be so lovely when you’re all alone. Here’s what you’ll keep saying when you’re far from home. Mammy, Mammy. The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where the sun shines best.”

The media simply grew quiet, their jaws agape.

“Mammy, my little Mammy,” Trump forged on, “My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. I’m comin’, sorry that I made you wait. I’m comin’, hope and trust that I’m not late, oh oh.

Mammy, my little Mammy. I’d walk a million miles for one of your smiles. My Mammy, oh oh.”

No one knew what to do, or what to say. So they just kept taking notes as Trump sang on.

“Mammy, my little Mammy,” Mr. Trump bellowed forth, “The sun shines east, the sun shines west. I know where, I know where the sun shines best. It’s on my Mammy I’m talkin’ about, nobody else’s. My little Mammy. My heartstrings are tangled around Alabammy. Mammy, Mammy, I’m comin’. I, I hope I didn’t make you wait.”

Now, it seemed that trump was building a crescendo. He was clearly ready to bring it all home. The reporters still just watched in stunned amazement.

“Mammy, Mammy, I’m comin’,” Trump sang, “Oh God I, I hope I’m not late. Mammy look at me. Don’t you know me? I’m your little baby. I’d walk a million miles for one of your smiles

My Mammy!”

A report from NPR shows that Trump lost the popular vote by a margin of two million votes to Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.

218,"Donald Trump’s newly appointed science and technology advisor, Yale University professor David Gelernter, has already attracted a barrage of criticism after making controversial statements this week during an exclusive interview with Science Today.

The controversial computer scientist already known for his strong stance against the science behind global warming has openly and vehemently criticized the space policy of the Barack Obama administration and its goal to reach Mars in 2030.

“ How can we manage to organize a U.S.-crewed orbital Mars mission by the mid-2030s when we never even went to the moon? The idea is laughable, as was Obama’s administration, if I may add ” – Yale Professor David Gelernter

“The Apollo moon landings are the biggest fraud in mankind’s history, even worse than all that global warming nonsense,” he added.

A voyage that never was

This is not the first time the controversial professor has attacked the Apollo moon landings. In his 2012 book America-Lite: How Imperial Academia Dismantled Our Culture (and Ushered in the Obamacrats) the author voices his concerns about the impossibility of space travel outside the Earth’s magnetic field.

“In the modern age, we have never been outside the Earth’s magnetic field. With the exception of the alleged 24 human beings who flew lunar flights in the Apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972, all human spaceflights have taken place in low Earth orbit (LEO) or below. Even the International Space Station conducts all its operations in LEO,” he explained in his book.

“Why is that? This is because orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation,” he wrote.

A dangerous belt of radiation

The Yale professor also documented in his book how NASA was, and still is, aware of the impossibility of traveling beyond the Van Allen Belt, a highly charged radioactive belt that is part of the planet’s magnetic field.

“The Apollo missions were supposed to be the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners, but even today, NASA scientists admit they can’t get past the Van Allen Belts” he claims in his 2012 book.

“If NASA scientists honestly admit in 2012 that they still haven’t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts, how the hell did we send human beings into space covered in aluminum foil suits? At a particular time when the Solar activity was at its peak? The answer is simple: It just never happened,” he concluded on the matter.

Despite his controversial claims, David Gelernter is a world-renown and multiple award-winning computer scientist known for his contributions to parallel computation and his early prediction of the rise of the World Wide Web.

Time Magazine profiled Gelernter as one of the 100 most influential people of the 21st century in 2016, describing him as an “arch-genius.” The New York Times called him a computer science “rock star” and “one of the most brilliant and visionary computer scientists of our time.”",Satire 
219,"Why Won’t You Just Let Us Pass a Health Care Bill and Kill a Few Million People?

Dear America,

At this point, it’s just getting frustrating. Time and time again, our party’s leaders have drafted and presented health care bills to repeal and replace Obamacare. We’ve tried this thing from all possible angles, but the backlash to each potential bill has been so severe that we haven’t been able to get anything passed. Where is all this negativity coming from?

We had Paul Ryan take a crack at an alternative health care bill, but he blew it hard. Then, Mitch McConnell stepped up to the plate, and he also blew it hard. Now, this thing is in the hands of Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, but constituent phone calls disparaging the bill are flooding all of our offices. This has forced our party to ask the American people a very important question: do you not want us to kill a few million people or something?

Look, we’re trying our best here. At any given point, we have twelve or so of our best and brightest old white men working on a health care alternative to Obamacare. A bunch of guys named Bradley and Ralph will not rest until working class Americans are screwed over real badly. It’s disheartening because we’re trying so hard, yet the American people still seem intent on rejecting any legislation we present just because a few million people might die. It’s almost like you people don’t want us to murder a huge chunk of the country.

Yes, we were the obstructionist party for eight years and we halted as much legislation as possible. But, now that we have control of Congress, we’re hell-bent on getting stuff done. We want to pass legislation! So, why won’t the American people just let us pass a health care bill that’ll treat pregnancy like a pre-existing condition and raise premiums for sick people? It’s completely ridiculous that you won’t let us kill a lot of poor people. Is that what this is all about? The millions of people who will die because they won’t be able to afford health care if we pass one of these bills? These very negative reactions to our death bills confuse and demoralize us.

Do you not like the name of the bill or something? Just say the word and we can have one of the Bradleys try naming the new health care bill something a bit more flashy. We just want to understand why so much skepticism is getting tossed our way. Is it all the impending death and suffering that any of these bills will entail? That can’t possibly be it. Why would so many average American citizens be against a systematic culling of the country’s working class, elderly, and disabled populations? It doesn’t make sense to us at all.

Lately, we feel like we just can’t win with you. Please let us pass a health care bill and kill a few million people. What is so wrong with that? Just let us do it. At the very least, you’ll need to explain to us why you disagree so intently with us unleashing a legislative plague across America.

Sincerely,

The GOP",Satire
